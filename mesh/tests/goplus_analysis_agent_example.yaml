    \ 332.85 (Exact denomination not specified in the provided data)\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n\
    \nBased on the provided security details, here's a risk assessment for the Heurist\
    \ (HEU) token:\n\n* **Liquidity Risk:** **Moderate** - Listed on UniswapV3, indicating\
    \ some level of liquidity, but the amount (332.85 units, denomination unspecified)\
    \ seems relatively low compared to the total supply.\n* **Ownership Risk:** **Unclear**\
    \ - The owner address appears generic, which could indicate a decentralized structure\
    \ or a potential issue with the data. This warrants further investigation.\n*\
    \ **Market Manipulation Risk:** **Low to Moderate** - With a small sell tax (0.01%)\
    \ and no buy tax, the environment seems conducive to trading. However, the concentration\
    \ of tokens among top holders (especially the first two, which are contracts)\
    \ could potentially lead to market manipulation if not properly managed.\n* **Security\
    \ Risk:** **Low** - Being open source and not identified as a honeypot or blacklisted\
    \ are positive indicators of the token's security posture.\n* **Overall Risk:**\
    \ **Moderate** - Primarily due to the unclear ownership situation and the potential\
    \ for market manipulation based on the holder distribution. The liquidity, while\
    \ present, is on the lower side, which could also impact the token's volatility.\n\
    \n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Investigate Ownership Structure:** Clarify the\
    \ ownership address to understand the project's governance better.\n2. **Monitor\
    \ Holder Activity:** Keep a close eye on the top holders, especially the contract\
    \ addresses, for any signs of market manipulation.\n3. **Liquidity Enhancement:**\
    \ Consider strategies to increase liquidity on UniswapV3 or expand to other DEXs\
    \ to reduce volatility.\n4. **Community Engagement:** Foster a transparent community\
    \ to build trust and potentially attract more holders, thus diluting concentration\
    \ risks."
