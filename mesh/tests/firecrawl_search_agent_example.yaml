          ## What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)?


          Imagine you have a secret and want to prove to someone that you know it
          without revealing it. Zero-knowledge proofs allow just that: proving something
          is true without sharing the details. For example, you could attend a football
          game without revealing your membership card''s personal details or verify
          you have sufficient funds without disclosing your exact bank balance. ZKPs
          enable privacy while providing proof of validity.


          Technically, ZKPs are cryptographic tools that allow verification of information''s
          truthfulness without revealing the information itself. This is incredibly
          useful in blockchain networks, where extensive information is typically
          shared to confirm transactions. With ZKPs, that information can remain private.


          Blockchain is evolving from traceability and full transparency to privacy
          with proof of truth. The key distinction is \*proof of validity\*. This
          marks a revolution in blockchain''s original concept and operating model—what
          some call Blockchain 2.0.


          This technological enhancement impacts the following:


          Scalability in Blockchain: ZKP technology improves speed and reduces costs.
          Instead of processing each transaction individually, multiple transactions
          are grouped and verified simultaneously. This is achieved through zero-knowledge
          rollups, enabling efficient off-chain verifications, with only compact results
          updating the main chain. This reduces congestion and transaction costs.


          Security in Supply Chains: Companies in sectors like logistics need to ensure
          product authenticity and quality without revealing sensitive information.
          ZKPs allow verification of critical supply chain data, such as a product''s
          origin or status, without exposing confidential details. For example, a
          company can prove a food item complies with regulations without sharing
          its entire production process, improving transparency and trust without
          compromising security or revealing proprietary details.


          Biometrics: In biometric security, protecting personal data is paramount.
          ZKP technology allows authentication using biometric data without storing
          the original information. Systems can generate cryptographic keys from facial
          features, enabling identity verification without risking data theft or misuse.


          Digital Identity and Verification: In identification systems, verifying
          a digital user''s identity is crucial. ZKPs allow verification that a vote
          is valid without revealing who cast it or their choice, protecting voter
          confidentiality while ensuring integrity. It’s like depositing a vote in
          a transparent ballot box that correctly counts the votes without showing
          how the ballot sheet was marked.


          Digital Finance: ZKPs enable secure and confidential financial transactions
          while reducing costs, crucial in a heavily regulated ecosystem.


          ## Challenges Facing ZKP Technology


          ZKPs faces several challenges hindering widespread adoption: First, generating
          and verifying proofs requires substantial computing power—it''s like your
          computer constantly solving very complex puzzles, which can be slow and
          expensive. Second, many are unaware of the technology and its potential
          benefits—it’s like having a very useful tool hidden in a drawer because
          no one knows what it''s for. Finally, interoperability between different
          blockchains is challenging due to varying specifications and protocols,
          making it difficult to integrate ZKP solutions uniformly.


          ## Future Trends


          ZKP technology is poised to integrate with other emerging technologies:


          Integration with Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI): Combining ZKPs
          with decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) could create privacy-respecting
          intelligent systems. Imagine a health app providing personalized advice
          without accessing your specific medical data—only whether you''re within
          certain ranges or conditions.


          Security Against Quantum Computers: Quantum computers are extremely powerful
          machines that, in the future, could crack many of the security systems we
          use today. ZKPs are being developed to resist potential attacks from future
          quantum computers, ensuring long-term information security. Think of it
          as a super-advanced lock that even the most sophisticated tools cannot open.
          This ensures that your information will remain secure, even when technology
          advances significantly.


          Mobile Devices with Web3 Technology: Mobile phones that use Web3 and ZKP
          technology will enable more private and secure applications. Imagine using
          a banking app on your phone that conducts transactions without sharing your
          personal data. Thanks to ZKP, these apps can operate securely on blockchain
          networks, protecting your information and making it inaccessible to unauthorized
          third parties.


          ## Conclusion


          Zero-Knowledge Proofs are revolutionizing online privacy and security –
          allowing something to be proven without revealing a secret or detailed personal
          information. This is a game changer particularly in regulated industries
          where breaches can result in significant fines and compensation.


          While challenges remain, advancements are making ZKPs more practical. This
          technology promises more secure and private systems for everyone, regardless
          of technical expertise.

          Our personal data is a new and valuable form of currency. We’ve become progressively
          more comfortable sharing our data with third parties, yet we don’t ask often
          enough what privacy and protection policies they have in place.


          When you book a hotel room, you hand over your passport for the front desk
          agent to scan and copy. When you file a health insurance claim, you submit
          detailed medical records that may reveal sensitive information unrelated
          to the specific claim. Each exchange exposes your personal data to an unknown
          number of people in these organizations. If your information is stored and
          saved, it is vulnerable to theft or data breaches, which are becoming alarmingly
          common.


          PROMOTED


          According to the Identity Theft Resource Center''s [2023 Annual Data Breach
          Report](https://www.idtheftcenter.org/post/2023-annual-data-breach-report-reveals-record-number-of-compromises-72-percent-increase-over-previous-high/
          "https://www.idtheftcenter.org/post/2023-annual-data-breach-report-reveals-record-number-of-compromises-72-percent-increase-over-previous-high/"),
          there was a 78% surge in data compromises from 2022 to 2023. Healthcare,
          financial services and transportation organizations reported a twofold increase
          in compromises compared to the previous year. In [a 2023 International Association
          of Privacy Professionals report](https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/privacy_and_consumer_trust_report_summary.pdf
          "https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/privacy_and_consumer_trust_report_summary.pdf"),
          almost 68% of global consumers said "they are either somewhat or very concerned
          about their online privacy," which "affects how much they trust companies,
          organizations and governments to collect, hold and use their personal data."
          More than 80% of people affected by a data breach said they are inclined
          to end their business relationship with a company after the cyberattack.


          ## The Potential Of Zero-Knowledge Proofs


          A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic technique that [dates back
          to the 1980s](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brief-history-zero-knowledge-proofs-100000129.html
          "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brief-history-zero-knowledge-proofs-100000129.html")
          and now offers immense promise in a wide range of practical applications.
          In simple terms, a zero-knowledge proof allows one party to confirm the
          validity of a piece of information with another party without revealing
          the information itself.


          For example, a ZKP can give you a secure key or certificate to prove to
          a bartender that you are of legal drinking age without showing your ID.
          It can also enable a credit card company to verify your creditworthiness
          without divulging your financial history. Zero-knowledge proofs have enormous
          potential to improve data privacy protocols in ways that benefit both organizations
          and individuals. They relieve organizations of the burden of safely gathering,
          storing and sharing people’s data—and managing the damaging repercussions
          if a breach occurs. And they give individuals enhanced identity and transaction
          verification capabilities that won’t put their personal data at risk.


          Real-world use cases of ZKPs include:


          **• Identity Verification:** Businesses can confirm a customer’s name, age,
          driver’s license or passport number, or other personally identifiable information
          (PII) without copying or storing it.


          **• Financial Services:** Banks and other financial institutions can assess
          a customer’s financial health or enable secure, private transactions without
          revealing sensitive information.


          **• Healthcare:** Providers can validate a patient''s insurance information,
          medical history or eligibility for specific treatments without disclosing
          PII.


          • **Voting Systems:** Voters can prove that they are eligible to vote and
          that their vote was counted while maintaining the privacy of their choices.


          • **Supply Chain Management:** Companies can authenticate products without
          revealing proprietary information.


          ## Overcoming Challenges In Implementing Zero-Knowledge Proofs


          While consumers and business leaders alike are showing a growing interest
          in tools that offer increased data privacy protections, implementing zero-knowledge
          proofs will require overcoming key hurdles. ZKP technology requires substantial
          computational power, which can be costly and resource-intensive for organizations
          to implement. There is a shortage of expertise in this emerging field of
          cryptography, making it challenging for businesses to find skilled professionals
          to develop and implement zero-knowledge proof systems. Integrating and scaling
          ZKP technology within organizations’ existing infrastructure and processes
          may also pose technical challenges that slow widespread adoption.


          I believe that in the next few years, we will begin to see a significant
          shift in our collective mindset about divulging our personal information.
          As zero-knowledge proof technology continues to advance and become more
          affordable, we will see a rapid uptake in adoption. In five or ten years''
          time, we could see changes such as the emergence of tokenized identities,
          eliminating the need to share actual ID numbers or documents, and a significant
          decrease in identity theft as sensitive data becomes less vulnerable to
          breaches.


          But we have to start changing our outlook and our actions now to prepare
          for this future. I recommend the following actions:


          ### 1\. Advocate For Government Implementation


          Government agencies are responsible for issuing and verifying valid identification
          documents, so making change at the governmental level is an important starting
          point. Push for agencies to invest in zero-knowledge proof systems that
          will drive broader adoption and standardization.


          ### 2\. Start With High-Value, Low-Complexity Use Cases


          For business applications, begin implementing ZKPs in areas that offer clear
          benefits and have manageable complexity, such as identity verification or
          regulatory compliance. Experiment with small projects, and learn and iterate
          as you expand into larger initiatives.


          ### 3\. Leverage Open-Source Frameworks


          Technology can advance far more quickly in an environment of collaboration.
          Utilize existing open-source zero-knowledge proof frameworks to accelerate
          development, reduce costs, share lessons learned and benefit from community-tested
          solutions.


          ### 4\. Invest In Education And Training


          A few years ago, "prompt engineer" was not a common job title. Now, with
          the explosion of generative AI, it''s an important role for many companies.
          Be proactive about investing in educating and training your team in the
          skills of the future, including in cryptography and zero-knowledge proof
          technology.


          Zero-knowledge proofs offer a powerful tool for safeguarding data privacy
          in a digital world. As the technology continues to advance, it will likely
          play a crucial role in guaranteeing permissions across various business
          use cases and protecting individuals'' privacy rights. If you understand
          the value of this technology and explore opportunities to leverage it effectively,
          your business will be ideally positioned to improve its security posture
          and build trust with your customers.

          # Solving An Open Problem in Zero-Knowledge Proofs   Established an approach
          for zero-knowledge arguments that do not leak secret information even if
          randomness is reused during proof generation


          News Highlights:


          1. ◆For the first time in the world, we have proved that the use of witness
          encryption1 is indispensable for the construction of highly secure zero-knowledge
          proofs2 called the resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument3,4.

          2. ◆This achievement contributes to the practical application of zero-knowledge
          proof, which is expected to be used in various fields such as finance, medical
          care, and healthcare, as one of the IOWN PETs5 aiming for "a world without
          plaintext."


          TOKYO - September 19, 2024 - NTT Corporation (Headquarters: Chiyoda Ward,
          Tokyo; Representative Member of the Board and President: Akira Shimada;
          hereinafter "NTT") has proved for the first time in the world that the use
          of witness encryption is essentially indispensable for the construction
          of the resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument, which is a zero-knowledge
          proof with high security. Zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic protocol
          that proves the validity of a statement without revealing additional information
          to the other party. As an example, this revolutionary technology can prove
          the knowledge of the correct password without disclosing the password. This
          achievement established a construction approach for the resettable statistical
          zero-knowledge argument, thereby greatly contributing to the practical application
          of zero-knowledge proofs, which are expected to be used in various fields
          such as finance, medical care, and healthcare in the future. This achievement
          was presented at the 44th Annual International Cryptology Conference (Crypto
          2024), the premier international conference on cryptology.


          ### 1\. Background


          Zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic protocol that proves the validity
          of a statement without disclosing any additional information. For example,
          it can be used as an authentication technology to prove the knowledge of
          the correct password without disclosing the password. It is also a revolutionary
          technology from the viewpoint of privacy protection because it enables age
          verification without presenting personal information to the other party
          (Figure 1). In recent years, it has attracted attention because it has also
          been used in cryptocurrencies to prove that transactions were executed correctly
          while keeping the contents of transactions secret.


          Resettable statistical zero-knowledge arguments are highly secure zero-knowledge
          proofs and known to be constructed using a cryptographic primitive called
          witness encryption. However, it has been an open question whether resettable
          statistical zero-knowledge arguments can be constructed without witness
          encryption.

          1 Example of Age Verification with Zero-Knowledge Proof


          ### 2\. Results and technical points of this research


          This time, we solved the open problem by proving that it is impossible to
          construct a resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument without using
          witness encryption. Specifically, we have shown that witness encryption
          can be constructed by using a resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument,
          thereby showing that constructing a resettable statistical zero-knowledge
          argument is equivalent to constructing witness encryption (Figure 2).


          As a technical point, in this research, instead of directly using the security
          of the resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument to construct witness
          encryption, we used it indirectly and constructed witness encryption from
          the resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument by the following two
          steps.


          1. First, we show that a resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument
          always satisfies certain properties because of its high security.

          2. Next, we show that witness encryption can be realized by using this property.


          Specifically, we first focus on the fact that the high security of the resettable
          statistical zero-knowledge argument places significant constraints on the
          messages sent by the prover, and show that in certain cases the messages
          sent by the prover must be determined only by the randomness used by the
          prover, independent of the secret information held by the prover. Next,
          we focus on the fact that this property can be used to realize witness encryption
          relatively easily, thereby constructing witness encryption from a resettable
          statistical zero-knowledge argument (Figure 3).

          We will continue to promote the R&D of zero-knowledge proofs as a technology
          of IOWN PETs, with the aim of achieving the goal of the "world without plaintext,"
          where safe data distribution is enabled by the technical guarantee that
          data will be used only within the scope of the data owner''s policy during
          the entire period from creation to destruction. In the future, we aim to
          utilize this technology for our LLM tsuzumi''s secure learning and to put
          it into practical use for IOWN PETs.

          1.Witness encryption


          Witness encryption is an encryption scheme proposed as a generalization
          of public-key encryption. In normal public-key encryption, encryption is
          performed with a public key and decryption is performed with the corresponding
          private key, but in witness encryption, encryption is performed with an
          arbitrary NP instance (e.g., mathematical theorems) and decryption is performed
          with the corresponding witness (e.g., proof of a theorem).


          2.Zero-knowledge proof


          Zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic protocol between two parties called
          a prover and a verifier. Broadly speaking, in a zero-knowledge proof, the
          prover tries to convince the verifier of the correctness of a statement
          in the following way: At the start of a proof, both the prover and the verifier
          have the statement to be proved as public information, and the prover has
          the evidence that the statement holds as secret information. (The evidence
          is called "witness.") Then, the prover proves that the statement is true
          by conducting a question-and-answer type interaction in which the prover
          answers the question by the verifier, and the verifier verifies the proof
          by checking the content of the response by the prover. Zero-knowledge proofs
          provide three security guarantees: completeness (a prover with appropriate
          evidence can prove a true statement), soundness (a malicious prover cannot
          prove a false statement), and zero-knowledge (a malicious verifier cannot
          learn information on the evidence beyond the validity of the statement).


          3.Statistical zero-knowledge argument


          Zero-knowledge proofs are classified into computational and statistical
          depending on what kind of computing power an adversary has in the definition
          of zero-knowledge, and also into proof and argument depending on what kind
          of computing power an adversary has in the definition of soundness. In the
          case of statistical zero-knowledge arguments, zero-knowledge is guaranteed
          against an adversary with unbounded computing power while soundness is guaranteed
          only against an adversary with realistically bounded computing power (specifically,
          what is called a polynomial-time adversary).


          4.Resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument


          The resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument is a statistical zero-knowledge
          argument that guarantees zero-knowledge even when multiple proofs are generated
          using the same randomness. Using randomness is essential for many cryptographic
          primitives, including zero-knowledge proofs. However, the generation of
          randomness (especially that having sufficiently high quality required for
          cryptographic primitives) requires high-cost operations such as the use
          of physical phenomena. An advantage of the resettable statistical zero-knowledge
          argument is that randomness generation is no longer necessary during proof
          generation. In particular, it guarantees zero-knowledge even if randomness
          is generated in advance and subsequently reused in every proof generation.
          Because of this advantage, the resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument
          can be used even in environments where it is difficult to generate randomness
          because of cost restrictions.

          # What is Zero-Knowledge Proof - a hot technology bringing trustworthiness
          to Web3 privacy?


          Recently, "zero-knowledge proof" is attracting attention. In 2019, the World
          Economic Forum announced zero-knowledge proof as one of the five privacy-enhancing
          technologies that bring new value to the financial sector (\*1). Why is
          this idea, invented in the 1980s, receiving attention now? This article
          gives an overview of the technology, examples of its application, and looks
          into its future.


          - (\*1) [World Economic Forum, "The Next Generation of Data-Sharing in Financial
          Services: Using Privacy Enhancing Techniques to Unlock New Value," September

          ## What is Zero-Knowledge Proof?


          Zero-knowledge proof; ZKP is a technology in which a person who wants to
          prove something (Prover; hereafter referred to as P) proves the fact that
          he knows the knowledge without giving any other knowledge to the person
          who wants to verify it (Verifier; hereafter referred to as V).


          As a result, V can only verify the fact that P knows the knowledge without
          obtaining any other knowledge (Figure 1).


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img01.png?h=378&iar=0&w=800&rev=6d7d71ac7c564b25984a2df33508640b)


          Figure 1: Concept of Zero-Knowledge Proof



          In the real world, when you want to assert that you hold certain credentials,
          it is common to present evidence to convince the other person that you hold
          the credentials.


          However, when you do so, the other person may be presented with too much
          information about what you want to prove, such as your address or age in
          the evidence. If you cannot trust the other person, you may feel uncomfortable
          giving them too much information. However, if you don''t show them the evidence,
          they are unlikely to trust your claim. How can you convince someone that
          you hold the qualification without giving them extra information?


          The technology to achieve this is zero-knowledge proof. The idea of zero-knowledge
          proof originated in cryptography research in the 1980s (\*2).


          - (\*2) [Goldwasser, S., Micali, S., Rackoff, C.: "The knowledge complexity
          of interactive proof-systems," STOC 1985.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/22145.22178)



          The claims that can be proven with zero-knowledge proof are knowledge about
          propositions. A proposition is a verbal expression of a judgment that is
          clearly true or false (\*3).


          - (\*3)

          For example, "2023 is equal to 7×17×17" is a proposition, and it is a true
          fact. "I know the prime factorization of 2023" is knowledge related to the
          stated proposition and is an example of a claim that can be used for zero-knowledge
          proof. On the other hand, "2023 is a large number" is subjective and not
          a proposition. Therefore, the claim that "I know 2023 is a big number" is
          not a subject of zero-knowledge proof.



          In general, a zero-knowledge proof must satisfy three properties: completeness,
          soundness, and zero-knowledge (Table 1).


          | Nature | Overview |

          | --- | --- |

          | Completeness | If the prover is correct, it will be determined to be correct
          by the verifier |

          | Soundness | If the prover is incorrect, it must be determined to be incorrect
          by the verifier with a high probability |

          | Zero-Knowledge | The verifier cannot obtain any knowledge other than the
          fact that the prover wants to prove |


          Table 1: Requirements for a zero-knowledge proof


          ## Intuitive understanding of Zero-Knowledge Proofs


          Here are two examples to help you understand zero-knowledge proofs intuitively.


          ### 1\. The cave problem


          This explanation was introduced in the paper "How to explain zero-knowledge
          protocols to your children" (\*4).


          - (\*4) [Jean-Jacques Quisquater et al., "How to Explain Zero-Knowledge
          Protocols to Your Children," CRYPTO 1989. (PDF: 227KB)](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mkowalcz/628.pdf)


          Inside the cave is a magic door that opens when you say the password. The
          prover P knows the password and gives it in exchange for money. The door
          is at the far end of the cave shown in Figure 2. There are two paths to
          the door, A and B. The person who knows the password can open the door and
          move from A to B or vice versa.


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img02.jpg?h=453&iar=0&w=800&rev=cf4c7228935441d3b38f0fd9442af117)


          Figure 2: The Cave Problem



          V, the verifier, wants to buy the password, but he doubts whether P really
          knows the password and cannot start a transaction. If P can convince V that
          P knows the secret password without telling V the secret password itself,
          V can start a transaction. So, here''s what they are trying to do.


          First, V waits outside the cave. Then P enters the cave, randomly chooses
          either path A or B, and goes to the door (Figure 3).


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img03.jpg?h=533&iar=0&w=800&rev=0918e3fa17984bbe8d735ff3c9df3166)


          Figure 3: Prover P''s Random Selection



          Next, V enters the cave, goes to the branching point of the paths, randomly
          chooses A or B in their head, and shouts to P to come out from the chosen
          path (Figure 4).


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img04.jpg?h=401&iar=0&w=800&rev=945bfc0651e54daea0b604e2edd6f2a4)


          Figure 4: Verifier V''s Random Selection



          If P knows the password:


          P can use the password to open the door and come out of the designated path,
          whichever way V tells him to go (Figure 5). This means completeness.


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img05.jpg?h=466&iar=0&w=800&rev=6088ed6bec1c4fd3a3ac05b15c69a53a)


          Figure 5: The Case that Prover P Knows the Password



          If P does not know the password:


          P can only come out of the path he entered, so the probability of coming
          out of the path chosen by V is 50%. If they repeat this process over and
          over again, it''s almost impossible for P to fool V every time (Figure 6).
          For example, if they try 30 times, the probability that P can fool V is
          about 0.0000001%. This means soundness.


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img06.jpg?h=421&iar=0&w=800&rev=db7f0b94506a47679157cddc1b1a33bf)


          Figure 6: The Case that Prover P Does Not Know the Password



          So, if P succeeds on all his attempts, V must be convinced that P knows
          the password. If V tries even more, he can get his chance of being cheated
          as close to 0% as V wants. At this time, V will not gain any knowledge about
          the password. This means zero-knowledge.


          Literally, what P wants to prove has been proved to V with zero-knowledge.


          ### 2\. The Problem of Finding a Seabird


          Professor Amit Sahai of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)
          explains the concept of zero-knowledge proof on YouTube to children, teenagers,
          college students, graduate students, and experts in five different difficulty
          levels (\*5). Here is a child-friendly explanations that will help you get
          a sense of the main points.


          - (\*5) [Computer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty,
          WIRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c)


          The professor shows the child a picture. The picture shows a crowd of hundreds
          of penguins. He says, "There is one puffin (a penguin-like seabird), and
          I know where it is, but I don''t want to tell you. Do you believe me? I''m
          going to prove it without revealing its location."

          Figure 7: The Problem of Finding a Seabird



          The professor pulls out a piece of black paper several times larger than
          the photo. The paper has a small hole, and the photo is pasted on the back
          of the paper so that the hole matches the position of the puffin. The child
          looks into the hole and says, "I see a puffin". But the child can''t see
          the position of the photo on the back of the paper, so she can''t tell where
          the puffin is in the original photo. "This is an example of a zero-knowledge
          proof," the professor explains (Figure 8).

          Figure 8: Zero-Knowledge Proof for the Problem of Finding a Seabird



          This exchange satisfies completeness because a professor who knows the location
          of the puffin can always prove it.


          Furthermore, it satisfies soundness because if the professor does not know
          the location of the puffin, the cheating will be exposed with a high probability
          if the child looks into the hole and confirms it.


          Furthermore, it satisfies zero-knowledge because the child cannot obtain
          any knowledge other than the fact that the professor knows the location
          of the puffin.


          ## Social Application Examples


          This paper introduces an application example of zero-knowledge proof to
          society and considers prospects.


          ### 1\. Blockchain Privacy Enhancement


          Blockchain is widely used in society, a representative example being virtual
          currencies. Its transparency is maintained by decentralized management of
          its ledger by all participants in the blockchain. However, due to its high
          transparency, securing user privacy may be a challenge.


          In recent years, zero-knowledge proofs have begun to be used to improve
          blockchain privacy. For example, in the case of cryptocurrencies, methods
          known collectively as zk-SNARK (\*6) and zk-STARK (\*7) have begun to be
          introduced as zero-knowledge proofs to show that the transaction operation
          was indeed performed, without disclosing the transaction contents such as
          the sender, recipient, and remittance amount.


          In addition, zero-knowledge proofs have attracted even more attention because
          they can contribute to speeding up blockchain processing.

          ### 2\. Proof of Income Range


          In November 2017, ING, a major Dutch bank, developed zero-knowledge range
          proofs (ZKRP) (\*8). ZKRP is an application of zero-knowledge proofs. ZKRP
          can prove that a numerical value, such as an amount of money, is within
          a certain range without showing the numerical value to the other party.
          For example, mortgage applicants can prove that their income is within a
          certain range required by loan screening without telling the income itself.

          to blockchain technology](https://www.ingwb.com/en/insights/distributed-ledger-technology/ing-launches-major-addition-to-blockchain-technology)


          ### 3\. Selective Disclosure of Attribute Information


          The W3C, which standardizes Web technologies, has standardized a data model
          for the concept of verifiable credentials (VC) (\*9). It introduces zero-knowledge
          proof, in which you select your attribute information and prove only that
          the attribute satisfies certain conditions.


          For example, it shows a use case in which you select and prove only the
          information that a university graduate received a degree without revealing
          his or her identity or other unnecessary personal information.


          - (\*9) [W3C Recommendation, Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1, 2022.](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#zero-knowledge-proofs)



          VC is currently being discussed in the "Trusted Web" initiative led by the
          Cabinet Secretariat of Japan. It shows the expectation of zero-knowledge
          proof as a method to realize selective disclosure of data(\*10).

          the Cabinet Secretariat of Japan, "Trusted Web White Paper Ver 2.0, Overview"
          August 2022 (PDF: 1.7MB)](https://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/digitalmarket/pdf_e/Trusted_Web_White_Paper_ver2.0_Overview.pdf)


          ### 4\. User Authentication


          Currently, ID and password authentication is mainly used for websites of
          various services. However, since the string length of a password is limited
          to a range that can be remembered or managed by the human brain, it is vulnerable
          to brute-force and password-list-type attacks.


          Furthermore, if an attacker takes over the server, not only the password
          itself, but also information useful for guessing the password is leaked,
          which becomes a hint for the attacker, and the password may be leaked in
          the future. If user authentication is implemented with zero-knowledge proof,
          the server can be more secure because no information related to the password
          exists from the beginning.


          As a zero-knowledge proof that can be applied to user authentication, there
          is the Schnorr protocol (\*11). In this method, knowledge about the solution
          of a mathematically difficult problem called the discrete logarithm problem
          is assumed to be information that only the user can know and is authenticated
          with zero-knowledge proof. Compared with the ID and password method, this
          method has not been adopted in the world for many years due to its disadvantages
          such as high communication volume, slow processing speed, and "The size
          of the data to be kept secret is too large for humans to remember."


          - (\*11) [IETF, RFC 8235, Schnorr Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof,
          September 2017](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8235)


          In recent years, however, with the spread of technologies such as "faster
          communication networks," "faster processing speeds of servers and terminals,"
          and "memory areas that can be securely stored in smart cards and smartphones,"
          conventional disadvantages are going to be no longer disadvantages.


          ## Prospect


          In recent years, the term "Web3" has attracted attention, and although there
          are various interpretations, its constituent concepts are said to be centered
          on "blockchain," "decentralization" and "decentralized ID." Application
          cases (1) and (2) mentioned above are measures to improve the privacy of
          blockchain, and (3) and (4) are related to decentralization and decentralized
          ID. Therefore, zero-knowledge proof can be said to be "a technology that
          brings trustworthiness to the privacy of Web3."


          In the future, zero-knowledge proof will become an essential technology
          for safe and secure future societies that require a high level of privacy.


          NTT DATA will continue to keep up with the latest trends and accumulate
          and disclose know-hows.

          \n# 01\\. Introduction\n\nIn a digital age rife with data breaches and online\
          \ vulnerabilities, building trust is more crucial than ever. Zero knowledge\
          \ proofs (zk proofs) offer an elegant solution beyond traditional privacy\
          \ measures by allowing one party to verify certain information without ever\
          \ disclosing the information itself.\n\nExperts say zk proofs have the potential\
          \ to revolutionize various industries, from finance and healthcare to luxury\
          \ fashion and decentralized systems like blockchain, ushering in a new era\
          \ of security and assurance. Independent research shows that zk proof generation\
          \ will become a $\\\\mathfrak{s}\\\\i0$ billion market by the year 2030.\
          \ Web3 services will require almost 90 billion zk proofs to be performed\
          \ in 2030, with market-wide completion of 83,000 transactions per second.\
          \ This report will cover some familiar zk proof territory, including the\
          \ differences between zk-STARKs and zkSNARKs, a timeline of innovations\
          \ in this space, challenges and future projections. The focus, however,\
          \ is today’s exciting inflection point where zk proofs are moving from research\
          \ projects to serious business – an analysis derived from new and firsthand\
          \ accounts from leading companies within the ecosystem of $^{250+}$ companies\
          \ that form the Protocol Labs innovation network. With a shared mission\
          \ to shape the future of computing, PL companies — including CryptoNet,\
          \ Gensyn, Ingonyama, Lurk Lab, Polybase, Rarimo, StarkWare, Zama — have\
          \ contributed to the world of zk proofs for years and will share their exclusive\
          \ insights in this report.\n\nCompanies like Lurk Lab zero in on the complex\
          \ mathematical models that form the basis of zk proofs. They believe the\
          \ zk proof space is poised for growth:\n\n“There’s been a decade of work\
          \ to improve zk protocols that are leading to real business – we’re even\
          \ seeing boutique venture capital firms that exclusively invest in this\
          \ space. We are at an inflection point of better technology and more capital\
          \ moving towards zk proofs,\" said John Burnham, cofounder of Lurk Lab.\
          \ \"It’s a Cambrian explosion.”\n\nThis report features exclusive research\
          \ and expert commentary on the properties of zk proofs, use cases, challenges,\
          \ potential disruptors, signs of momentum and future outlook.\n\nIngonyama,\
          \ a PL network team that solves for hardware limitations by building semi-conductors\
          \ to accelerate zkSNARKs, stresses the importance of privacy in the next\
          \ iteration of the internet:\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/710b1f29-1cb6-4e92-958b-2dd810937687/images/56ff147a935b9d92a3fcdecfc44cadc9fa3fcaef306b761939add29d16821bea.jpg)\n\
          \nElan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama\n\n“Information is the most\
          \ valuable currency in the world. Yet we are all guilty of oversharing our\
          \ data to third parties on the internet. Today if you want to prove one\
          \ aspect of yourself, such as age, you must upload an ID which contains\
          \ so much extra information —  full name, address, country of citizenship,\
          \ etc. What happens to that data? Often we find it's been leaked or stolen.\
          \ This scenario happens every day in the digital world. The problem of oversharing\
          \ can be solved by zk proofs, which are the most powerful cryptography that\
          \ exists today for hiding data, while allowing for assertions on that data.\
          \ ZK proofs are considered one of the greatest achievements of cryptography\
          \ in the last 50 years.”\n\n# 02\\. What are ZeroKnowledge Proofs?\n\nPicture\
          \ this:\n\nYou’re driving in an upscale neighborhood and spot the perfect\
          \ house. You dial the realtor’s number, ready to hear the asking price.\
          \ What if there was a way to prove to the realtor right away that you’re\
          \ good for the money — no matter the cost — without revealing the total\
          \ amount in your bank account? You could maintain your financial privacy\
          \ and put in an offer right away.\n\nHere enters the concept of a zero knowledge\
          \ proof (zk proof). In this scenario, you present a zk proof to confirm\
          \ you have enough funds for the down payment without revealing your entire\
          \ bank balance or personal wealth. By establishing trust without unnecessary\
          \ disclosures, zk proofs find practical application in various daily scenarios\
          \ — ensuring secure digital transactions, verifying identity without exposing\
          \ sensitive data, and revolutionizing privacy in the digital age.\n\nIn\
          \ 1985, Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff first introduced\
          \ the concept of zk proofs to the world. Years later, one of their mentees,\
          \ Rosario Gennaro, a researcher and former data scientist at Protocol Labs,\
          \ wrote a highly cited paper about more efficient, publicly verifiable computer\
          \ schemes that is still relied on today. He shares an example of a zk proof\
          \ with a technical explanation here:\n\n# Step by Step Example of a ZK Proof\n\
          \nstep 01.\n\nstep 02.\n\n# Setup\n\nEmily and David agree on the secret\
          \ vault's combination, but they want to ensure that Emily truly knows it\
          \ without exposing it.\n\n# Prover (Emily)\n\nEmily takes on the role of\
          \ the prover. She uses a zk proof technique to demonstrate her knowledge\
          \ of the combination without revealing what it is. Instead of showing the\
          \ combination directly, she performs a series of cryptographic operations\
          \ that prove she possesses the knowledge.\n\n# step 04.\n\nstep 03.\n\n\
          # Proof Generation\n\nEmily follows David's instructions using the knowledge\
          \ she has without revealing the combination itself. She provides the result\
          \ of her operations to David.\n\n# Verifier (David)\n\nDavid is the verifier\
          \ in this scenario. He wants to be convinced that Emily actually knows the\
          \ combination. David challenges Emily by asking her to prove her knowledge.\
          \ He provides specific instructions, such as asking her to perform operations\
          \ on the combination without revealing it.\n\n# step 05.\n\n# Verification\n\
          \nDavid checks Emily's response. If it's correct based on the instructions\
          \ he provided, he becomes convinced that Emily knows the combination without\
          \ actually learning the combination himself. If Emily didn't know the combination,\
          \ it would be highly improbable for her to consistently provide correct\
          \ responses based on David's instructions.\n\nIn this example, the prover\
          \ (Emily) demonstrates her knowledge of the combination to the verifier\
          \ (David) without revealing the actual combination. This showcases the core\
          \ concept of zk proofs, where one party can prove knowledge of certain information\
          \ without disclosing that information to the other party, ensuring privacy\
          \ and security in various applications like authentication and cryptography.\n\

          \ arithmetic constraints.\n\n2022\n\nThe zkSync project releases zkSync\
          \ 2.0, a new zk rollup that is designed to be more efficient and scalable\
          \ than previous zk rollups.\n\nTwo cryptographic techniques, created in\
          \ tandem, fall under the umbrella of zk proofs: zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs.\
          \ Both aim to achieve similar goals of proving the validity of statements\
          \ without revealing the underlying data, but they differ in their underlying\
          \ mechanisms and use cases~\n\nvzk-SNARK is a type of zk proof that allows\
          \ a prover to demonstrate the truth of a statement to a verifier in a succinct\
          \ and non-interactive manner. It's particularly associated with privacy-preserving\
          \ transactions in blockchain and cryptocurrency systems, like Zcash.\x88\
          \ vzk-STARK is another type of zk proof that also allows for proving the\
          \ validity of statements without revealing the underlying data. Though it\
          \ requires interaction, it achieves better security by removing the need\
          \ for trusted setups, unlike zk-SNARKs.\n\nFor details on zk-SNARKS vs zk-STARKS,\

          \nIn a zk proof-based voting system, voters can prove that their vote is\
          \ valid without revealing the actual choice they made. This maintains the\
          \ secrecy of individual votes, while ensuring that the total count is accurate.\
          \ Similar to the way they are used today by DAOs, zk proofs can be used\
          \ to verify properties of the election process, such as the absence of double\
          \ voting or the integrity of the tally, without revealing specific voter\
          \ information.\n\n# Cryptocurrencies\n\nZcash may be the most notable cryptocurrency\
          \ dedicated to preserving privacy – and zk proofs play a crucial role. They\
          \ enable confidential transactions where the sender, receiver, and transaction\
          \ amounts are hidden, while still ensuring the validity of transactions.\
          \ ZK proofs can also verify the correctness of smart contracts without revealing\
          \ the underlying data.\n\n# Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nResearch shows\
          \ that the DeFi market is growing rapidly and consistently, nearly doubling\
          \ each year since 2018. According to data, the market is set to reach $\\\
          \\mathbb{567.4}$ billion by 2026. This translates to corresponding growth\
          \ in the zk proof space, as DeFi platforms leverage zk proofs to enhance\
          \ privacy and scalability.\n\nZK proofs are used to validate transactions\
          \ and operations off-chain, while providing cryptographic proof of their\
          \ correctness on-chain. This reduces the computational load on the blockchain\
          \ and speeds up transaction processing. ZK proofs can also be used in decentralized\
          \ exchanges to prove that users possess the necessary funds for trading\
          \ without disclosing their exact balances.\n\nSince 2019, when DeFi was\
          \ relatively new, its quarter-on-quarter growth has risen at a rapid rate,\
          \ with over 6 million unique wallets completing an onchain transaction each\
          \ month since late-2022.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/710b1f29-1cb6-4e92-958b-2dd810937687/images/7c559b632ab6131d332d3f8eea7f47f8277d096db11dd432fc77de4c79a1dfe6.jpg)\n\

          \nZK proofs can be used to verify and authenticate the origin, movement,\
          \ and authenticity of products within a supply chain without revealing sensitive\
          \ proprietary information. This can enhance transparency by allowing different\
          \ entities to independently verify the accuracy of claims made about products,\
          \ such as their source, quality, and journey through the supply chain. For\
          \ example, zk proofs could be employed to prove that a product was ethically\
          \ sourced, without disclosing proprietary supplier data.\n\n# Environmental\
          \ Standards\n\nZK proofs can be applied to verify compliance with environmental\
          \ standards without revealing sensitive business data. For instance, companies\
          \ can demonstrate that they meet certain emissions reduction targets without\
          \ sharing specific emission levels or proprietary information. This aids\
          \ in maintaining transparency and accountability while protecting sensitive\
          \ information.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/710b1f29-1cb6-4e92-958b-2dd810937687/images/c2f311339e4d23e49af6697ef3a576f8b443b426322a4a681843186f3e956e57.jpg)\n\
          \nSid Gandhi, co-founder of Polybase Powered by zk proofs, Polybase is a\
          \ layer 2 blockchain with private transactions and MEV-resistance. A member\
          \ of the PL innovation network, Polybase’s co-founder Sid Gandhi shares\
          \ an example of an energy use case in the real world.\n\n“One of the largest\
          \ European energy companies wants to offer transparent data around renewable\
          \ energy generation. Rather than quarterly manual audits, we look at real\
          \ time data being generated from renewable resources. What percentage of\
          \ the energy generated and sent to this particular client is green? Doing\
          \ that in a cryptographically verifiable way isn't really possible. Consider\
          \ data centers that don't want to reveal second-by-second energy data that\
          \ they are consuming – that can be used for competitive intelligence.\n\n\
          What we allow with zk is the ability to keep that private data private,\
          \ but then prove some public attributes of that data. So we could prove\
          \ points like: what percentage of the data generated at this particular\
          \ time is renewable? That's a very motivating use case for us, because that\
          \ solves a real problem in the real world that we've seen with real customers.\
          \ It's really exciting for us to be able to tackle this problem.”\n\n# 05\\\
          . 4 Exciting Bets in ZK Proofs\n\nIn the evolving landscape of zk proof\
          \ technology, there are several projects and cutting-edge techniques that\
          \ are pushing the boundaries of what's possible, with a primary focus on\
          \ enhancing efficiency, scalability, and usability. These innovative efforts\
          \ are not only shaping the future of zk proofs, but also working towards\
          \ broader adoption across various domains.\n\nAs these projects continue\
          \ to mature and gain traction, the potential for zk proofs to revolutionize\
          \ industries beyond cryptocurrency becomes increasingly evident, offering\
          \ a promising future where privacy and security are paramount in our digital\
          \ interactions.\n\nResearch shows that\n\n6 The zk proof market is projected\
          \ to reach $\\\\mathbb{575}$ million in revenue in 2024,\n\n6 Has the potential\
          \ to exceed $\\\\mathfrak{s}\\\\mathord{\\\\uparrow}0$ billion in revenue\
          \ by the year 2030,\n\n6 Web3 applications alone are expected to require\
          \ almost 90 billion zk proofs in 2030,\n\n6 The average market clearing\

          \ in 2024 to $\\\\mathbb{50.12}$ by 2030\n\nTo that end, here are four big\
          \ bets designed to increase adoption, including three top projects and one\
          \ important technique that is helping build more efficient, scalable zk\
          \ proof systems.\n\nSource: Aligned.co , 2023\n\nA concept within the Ethereum\
          \ ecosystem aimed at developing a zk proof system that is compatible with\
          \ the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It involves various stakeholders,\
          \ including developers, researchers, and the Ethereum community. This would\
          \ allow zk proofs to be used for a wide variety of Ethereum applications.\n\
          \n# 2zkSync\n\nA method and project focused on developing zk rollups, a\
          \ type of layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. ZK rollups use zk proofs\
          \ to bundle multiple transactions together, verify them off-chain, and then\
          \ submit a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This significantly reduces\
          \ the computational load on the Ethereum network and enhances its scalability.\
          \ Examples8\n\n^ zkSync is also the name of a specific project that has\
          \ been developed to implement this method. It is initiated and maintained\
          \ by Matter Labs, a company focused on improving the scalability and usability\
          \ of blockchain networks. The zkSync project includes the development of\
          \ the zkSync protocol, smart contract infrastructure, and associated toolsA\n\
          \n^ Emerging zk rollups, such as zkSync Era, have witnessed a growth in\
          \ their total value locked (TVL) surging to $\\\\mathfrak{s}668$ million\
          \ in June 30, 2023, according to Crypto.com.  This signifies an impressive\
          \ $660%$ increase from $\\\\pmb{\\\\mathbb{S}88}$ million on April 1, 2023A\n\
          \n^ Research shows that the Total Value Locked (TVM) in ZK rollups is currently\
          \ over $\\\\tt{57.5B}$ to date. Mid-September 2021 saw all scaling solutions\
          \ adoption, including zk rollups, skyrocket:\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/710b1f29-1cb6-4e92-958b-2dd810937687/images/f075e2a96fb3d24dc63c9629aa3fb5867272ceb39d3ba0041368266a99626085.jpg)\n\
          \n# 3zk-STARKs\n\nThere's exciting development around this proof system\
          \ that is even more efficient and scalable than previous systems. This could\
          \ make zk proofs practical for a wider range of applications.\n\n# 4Recursive\
          \ zk proofs\n\nA technique that allows for the aggregation of multiple proofs\
          \ into a single proof, drastically reducing the computational overhead of\
          \ verification. This innovation has contributed to improved scalability\
          \ in zk proof systems, making them more efficient for applications with\
          \ a high transaction volume.  Usually, the way it is used is in evolving\
          \ computation: First, it breaks the computation to be proven into smaller\
          \ steps and proves them iteratively. Each step contains a proof, proving\
          \ the current state of the computation. Then, a new proof for the next step\
          \ can be generated by using the current step and its proof recursively showing\
          \ the correctness of all prior steps alltogether. The proof update does\
          \ not require recomputing from the very first step as in a standard zk proof,\
          \ and it is independent of the total length of the computation.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/710b1f29-1cb6-4e92-958b-2dd810937687/images/50a077cf990e6a7568d6590328c1d3f1f580cd29ede2dad7a403e04a5f986657.jpg)\n\

          \ This is the Holy Grail: to generate a proof with zero overhead and super\
          \ small proof size. Now, we have achieved super small proof sizes, but with\
          \ other big trade-offs. Generally the trade-off is: it becomes more expensive.”\n\
          \nNicola Greco, research scientist, CryptoNet\n\n# 2Scalability\n\nWhile\
          \ zk proofs can aggregate multiple proofs and transactions, scalability\
          \ challenges can arise when dealing with a high volume of transactions.\
          \ Generating and verifying a large number of proofs may introduce bottlenecks.\
          \ Achieving strong privacy guarantees through zk proofs might involve trade-offs\
          \ in terms of transaction speed, network overhead, or computational load.\
          \ Striking the right balance between privacy and performance is crucial.\n\
          \nResearch scientist Rosario Gennaro explains that building a zk proof involves\
          \ running a program that stores the state of the virtual machine at every\
          \ step of the proof, making space a bottleneck to growth and speed of transaction.\
          \ Folding schemes present a solution for proofs that are computed at every\
          \ step of a computation: given a proof with correct computation up to, for\
          \ example, step 4, the next correctness proof is obtain by \"folding\" the\
          \ proof of correctness of step 5 into the previous proof, without the need\
          \ to store the state of the computation at every stage.\n\nRosario Gennaro,\
          \ Professor at The City University of New York\n\n“Instead of writing the\
          \ entire transcript for the computation down at each step, folding compresses\
          \ the computation and solves the space problem. There is a lot of work happening\
          \ on implementing folding schemes to build efficient zk virtual machines,\
          \ ranging from Web2 companies like Microsoft to cutting edge startups like\
          \ Lurk Lab. While this bottleneck hasn’t been fully resolved, it’s one area\
          \ where we are ahead of the curve to solve the issue and definitely an area\
          \ to watch.”\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/710b1f29-1cb6-4e92-958b-2dd810937687/images/370bc7f5887fac864386679801cf1ffab6db8b6348a297eca19eca6642988b8e.jpg)\n\
          \n# 3Trusted Setup\n\nSome zk proof systems require a trusted setup phase\
          \ to generate initial parameters. The trusted setup phase requires that\
          \ the individuals or entity responsible for generating these parameters\
          \ act honestly and do not keep any secret information that could compromise\
          \ the security of the system. If this setup is compromised or not performed\
          \ correctly, it can undermine the security and privacy guarantees of the\
          \ system. The field of zk proofs is rapidly evolving, with new advancements\
          \ and potential vulnerabilities regularly emerging. Continuous research\
          \ and development are essential to address security issues and improve the\
          \ efficiency of zk proof systems.\n\n# 4Interoperability\n\nDifferent zk\
          \ proof systems might use distinct standards and protocols, making it challenging\
          \ to achieve interoperability between different systems. Creating common\
          \ standards would enhance compatibility and efforts are currently underway\
          \ with the likes of The ZKProof Community. ZK proofs also often come with\
          \ proof sizes that can be large, making them less efficient to transmit\
          \ and store. Efforts to minimize proof size while maintaining security are\
          \ ongoing. To support standardization, Polybase has released a new zk benchmark\
          \ site,  [https://zkbench.dev/](https://zkbench.dev/), with detailed comparison\
          \ tables and open community reviews.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/710b1f29-1cb6-4e92-958b-2dd810937687/images/df233b43e2367705b1d403af7683e60927bdac7de5c1e23a174e60a5cd9ea30b.jpg)\n\
          \nSid Gandhi, co-founder of Polybase “We're at that phase in the industry\
          \ where people understand the high level capability, like keeping data private,\
          \ proving things publicly, but there is still a big educational aspect around\
          \ the trade-offs and the technical implementation, and, potentially, what\
          \ other options are available, what trade-offs exist with those options\
          \ as well. So, we are doing quite a bit of education. And then, the next\
          \ step after that is selling our actual product. So it's a two-step process\
          \ right now.”\n\n# Hardware Acceleration\n\nHardware acceleration techniques,\
          \ such as using trusted execution environments (TEEs) or specialized hardware\
          \ like ASICs, have enabled faster and more efficient computation of zk proofs.\
          \ This breakthrough has the potential to make zk proofs practical for real-time\
          \ applications.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/710b1f29-1cb6-4e92-958b-2dd810937687/images/8eda1ef245afb5cead9ee087f634d29759311a06dccf3e7ee5a302364ef89ab0.jpg)\n\
          \nElan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama\n\n“Today's hardware is not\
          \ built for zero knowledge. ZK proofs require a massive amount of computational\
          \ resources and existing hardware (CPUs, GPUs) are not designed to handle\
          \ this computation efficiently. The main bottleneck is proof generation,\
          \ which is still too slow and expensive. In terms of timing, zk algorithms\
          \ have been developed for four decades, and zk software engineering for\
          \ about 10 years. The missing ingredient is specialized hardware in order\
          \ to accelerate proof generation, which is needed in order to commoditize\
          \ the technology and make it accessible to everyone.\n\nZK proof generation\
          \ must be an order of magnitude faster than it is today for real world use-cases.\
          \ And that's what we're working on. Most of the demand today comes from\
          \ the blockchain industry for scaling and privacy, but what makes me even\
          \ more excited for zk proofs is the fact that once we get outside of the\
          \ Web3 ecosystem, zk can impact nearly every industry, from medical research\
          \ to AI, to decentralized ID, to new online multiplayer gaming architectures,\
          \ and beyond.”\n\n# 08\\. The Future of ZK Proofs\n\n# 1Seamlessness\n\n\
          The industry is evolving at a rapid pace, with a focus on moving from research\
          \ to a business-led model. On one hand, the near future is focused on addressing\
          \ challenges and roadblocks in this space, which include hardware acceleration\
          \ and faster computation. Here, PL network teams share their top three projections\
          \ for the zk proof space in the near future.\n\nIn the next 2-5 years, Rarify\
          \ Labs expects an era of widespread integration of zk proofs across multiple\
          \ protocols and technologies. Its presence will revolutionize privacy, digital\
          \ identities, and blockchain performance, all while being seamless and mostly\
          \ invisible to users, similar to the way SSL and secure enclaves in phones\
          \ are invisible to users. ZK technology will have a user-centric flow that\
          \ enables scaling and accessibility across the digital identity space.\n\
          \n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/710b1f29-1cb6-4e92-958b-2dd810937687/images/68d667d380b1ab01e607a08caf04b6546a27c8d101ac63eeb9e219caa4d6004d.jpg)\n\
          \nKitty Horlick, Director, Rarify Labs\n\n“ZK proofs will help dissolve\
          \ the boundaries between Web2 and Web3, particularly within the identity\
          \ space as it is currently the only technology that sits across both realms.\
          \ More generally, zk proofs will massively reduce computation complexity\
          \ and help deliver truly performant blockchains.”\n\n# 2Client side integration\n\
          \nIn the ever-evolving landscape of cryptography, Ingonyama believes zk\
          \ proofs will transcend server-side applications and find their place within\
          \ the very devices we carry in our pockets. Imagine the power of a world\
          \ with zk proof hardware embedded directly in your mobile device, capable\
          \ of running a proof of ownership or proof of personhood.\n\n“We envision\
          \ a future in which zk is not just running on the server side like data\
          \ centers and cloud, but also on the client side – in mobile phones and\
          \ gaming machines. ZK technology is fundamental to trustless compute. We're\
          \ working to make efficient, zk proof hardware accelerators that can run\
          \ everywhere.” said Elan Neiger, marketing lead at Ingonyama.\n\n# Cost\
          \ efficient proofs\n\nAs zk proof methods evolve and proofs themselves become\
          \ smaller in size and more cost effective, they will become an attractive\
          \ option within the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT). Currently, IoT\
          \ devices store all their data in centralized storage and data is stored\
          \ directly onto their servers. ZK proofs allow for proofs to be used in\
          \ place of stored data, creating efficiencies and cutting costs.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/710b1f29-1cb6-4e92-958b-2dd810937687/images/9aff3383de21b1456b531420a3159a5518249a442de87a435f9a2a4fde2963ce.jpg)\n\
          \nElan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama\n\n“Another focus for the future\
          \ of zk lies with the Internet of Things (IoT). With zero knowledge, it\
          \ will be possible to cut the costs of data storage, by sending proofs instead\
          \ of data to confirm that specific stages or conditions have been met. Zero-Knowledge\
          \ also allows for yes /  no answers to complex questions involving data\
          \ or sensitive personal information. For example: do you have enough money\
          \ in your bank account to buy this car - Yes or no?  ZK today is still a\
          \ small market, but growing, because it is the most powerful cryptography\
          \ that exists for hiding data, while allowing for assertions on that data.”\n\
          \nEducation and standardization are key to the evolution of zk proofs. To\
          \ that end, Ingonyama launched an open source community effort in August\
          \ 2023: Ingopedia, a repo for all things zk for beginners and experts, ranging\
          \ from video tutorials to academic research (link). Ingopedia has been widely\
          \ cited as a good place to dive into the deep end of zero knowledge.\n\n\
          # Potential Disruptors\n\nAs the industry evolves, researchers and developers\
          \ are keeping an eye out for potential disruptors. These include quantum\
          \ computers, homomorphic encryption and interdisciplinary innovations:\n\
          \n# 1Quantum Computing\n\nIf large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers\
          \ become a reality, they could potentially break certain cryptographic primitives\
          \ that underpin zk proofs. However, should quantum computing become a reality,\
          \ we will have to change all the deployed cryptographic schemes. There is\
          \ already great progress with quantum-resistant encryption to date and industry\
          \ leaders are making strides with quantum resistant SNARKs as well.\n\n\
          Rosario Gennaro, Professor at The City University of New York\n\n“All is\
          \ not lost with the advent of quantum computing. In the future, we will\
          \ see quantum resistant SNARKs. We know how to do quantum resistant encryption\
          \ at this point. Should a quantum computer show up tomorrow, it will change\
          \ everything. It won’t happen overnight, but we'll get there.”\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/710b1f29-1cb6-4e92-958b-2dd810937687/images/983de6d97fe9c2c49af38b307b680e4a4235924a6f268d216ab0a1dada2ea027.jpg)\n\
          \n# 2Homomorphic Encryption\n\nFully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows\
          \ computations to be performed on encrypted data without the need to decrypt\
          \ it. FHE and zk proofs serve different roles in cryptography, and their\
          \ use cases often complement each other rather than disrupt each other.\
          \ While FHE can be used for secure computation and privacy-preserving data\
          \ analysis, zk proofs are typically employed for proving statements about\
          \ data or knowledge without revealing that data or knowledge. However, if\
          \ zk proofs over FHE computations were deployed, it could enable a new level\
          \ of privacy-preserving computation, where not only the data, but also the\
          \ operations performed on the data remain hidden. This would have significant\
          \ implications for secure cloud computing, private data analysis, and more.\n\
          \nActively building in this space, PL network team Zama is building an open\
          \ source framework that enables developers to use homomorphic encryption\
          \ to secure their Web2 and Web3 apps, without having to know cryptography.\
          \ The homomorphic programs can then be deployed locally, to the cloud or\
          \ to their upcoming decentralized infrastructure.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/710b1f29-1cb6-4e92-958b-2dd810937687/images/98fdf9e11e6ad299d5f85c1ec009ce7878ab8177d0a8632d2432904bf17881b4.jpg)\n\
          \nRand Hindi, co-founder of Zama\n\n“While zk’s strength is in verifiability,\
          \ FHE focuses on privacy. When you combine the two together, you have the\
          \ ideal solution, because you can have confidential computing that is actually\
          \ verified. And so it's an area we’re very excited about. But zk has difficulty\
          \ scaling existing tech. The way you implement zk is complicated, you have\
          \ to resort to incredibly complex protocols. By contrast, FHE is just a\
          \ smart contract running on-chain, like every other smart contract. But\
          \ again, FHE cannot do what zk does, which is to prove that a computation\
          \ is correct. This is why the future will likely see compatibility between\
          \ the two, with zk for verifiability and FHE for privacy.”\n\n# 3Interdisciplinary\
          \ Innovations\n\nAs the adoption of zk proofs expands, experts from various\
          \ fields may come together to create novel applications and protocols. For\
          \ example, collaborations between cryptographers, blockchain developers,\
          \ AI researchers, and economists could lead to innovative solutions that\
          \ we can't foresee yet. This cross-pollination of ideas might result in\
          \ entirely new use cases and disruptive applications for zk proofs.\n\n\

          \nHarry Grieve, Co-Founder of Gensyn “Platforms will mature to the point\
          \ where they’re ready for production use and then (hopefully) many applications\
          \ will start appearing beyond the current under-the-hood/ scalability systems\
          \ like zkEVMs or the current iteration of Starknet. We’re most excited about\
          \ the applications in machine learning.”\n\nRecommendations & Advice\n\n\
          # Stay Updated with Research\n\nZero knowledge proofs is an evolving field\
          \ with constant advancements. Stay updated with the latest research papers,\
          \ conferences, and discussions in cryptography and related domains to remain\
          \ informed about new techniques and developments.\n\n# Experiment and Prototype\n\
          \nStart by experimenting with existing zk proof libraries and tools. Creating\
          \ prototypes will give you hands-on experience and help you grasp the practical\
          \ aspects of using zk proofs. Collaborate with other researchers, developers,\
          \ and experts in the field. It's a great way to learn the strengths and\
          \ limitations of different zk proof systems.\n\n# Focus on Real-World Applications\n\
          \nWhile theoretical research is important, also consider practical applications.\
          \ Think about how zk proofs can solve real-world problems like privacy-preserving\
          \ data sharing, secure authentication, or improving blockchain scalability.\n\
          \nNicola Greco, research scientist, CryptoNet\n\n“After many years, we finally\
          \ have efficient proof schemes. By efficient, I mean that the prover time\
          \ versus the normal computation time is getting closer and closer. The closer\
          \ we get, the more we can have more applications that can be verified. In\
          \ 2023, it's close enough to verify blockchain transactions. And maybe in\
          \ the future, it can be closer to verify any computation.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\
