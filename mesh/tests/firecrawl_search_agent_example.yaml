        ## What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)?


        Imagine you have a secret and want to prove to someone that you know it without
        revealing it. Zero-knowledge proofs allow just that: proving something is
        true without sharing the details. For example, you could attend a football
        game without revealing your membership card''s personal details or verify
        you have sufficient funds without disclosing your exact bank balance. ZKPs
        enable privacy while providing proof of validity.


        Technically, ZKPs are cryptographic tools that allow verification of information''s
        truthfulness without revealing the information itself. This is incredibly
        useful in blockchain networks, where extensive information is typically shared
        to confirm transactions. With ZKPs, that information can remain private.


        Blockchain is evolving from traceability and full transparency to privacy
        with proof of truth. The key distinction is \*proof of validity\*. This marks
        a revolution in blockchain''s original concept and operating model—what some
        call Blockchain 2.0.


        This technological enhancement impacts the following:


        Scalability in Blockchain: ZKP technology improves speed and reduces costs.
        Instead of processing each transaction individually, multiple transactions
        are grouped and verified simultaneously. This is achieved through zero-knowledge
        rollups, enabling efficient off-chain verifications, with only compact results
        updating the main chain. This reduces congestion and transaction costs.


        Security in Supply Chains: Companies in sectors like logistics need to ensure
        product authenticity and quality without revealing sensitive information.
        ZKPs allow verification of critical supply chain data, such as a product''s
        origin or status, without exposing confidential details. For example, a company
        can prove a food item complies with regulations without sharing its entire
        production process, improving transparency and trust without compromising
        security or revealing proprietary details.


        Biometrics: In biometric security, protecting personal data is paramount.
        ZKP technology allows authentication using biometric data without storing
        the original information. Systems can generate cryptographic keys from facial
        features, enabling identity verification without risking data theft or misuse.


        Digital Identity and Verification: In identification systems, verifying a
        digital user''s identity is crucial. ZKPs allow verification that a vote is
        valid without revealing who cast it or their choice, protecting voter confidentiality
        while ensuring integrity. It’s like depositing a vote in a transparent ballot
        box that correctly counts the votes without showing how the ballot sheet was
        marked.


        Digital Finance: ZKPs enable secure and confidential financial transactions
        while reducing costs, crucial in a heavily regulated ecosystem.


        ## Challenges Facing ZKP Technology


        ZKPs faces several challenges hindering widespread adoption: First, generating
        and verifying proofs requires substantial computing power—it''s like your
        computer constantly solving very complex puzzles, which can be slow and expensive.
        Second, many are unaware of the technology and its potential benefits—it’s
        like having a very useful tool hidden in a drawer because no one knows what
        it''s for. Finally, interoperability between different blockchains is challenging
        due to varying specifications and protocols, making it difficult to integrate
        ZKP solutions uniformly.


        ## Future Trends


        ZKP technology is poised to integrate with other emerging technologies:


        Integration with Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI): Combining ZKPs
        with decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) could create privacy-respecting
        intelligent systems. Imagine a health app providing personalized advice without
        accessing your specific medical data—only whether you''re within certain ranges
        or conditions.


        Security Against Quantum Computers: Quantum computers are extremely powerful
        machines that, in the future, could crack many of the security systems we
        use today. ZKPs are being developed to resist potential attacks from future
        quantum computers, ensuring long-term information security. Think of it as
        a super-advanced lock that even the most sophisticated tools cannot open.
        This ensures that your information will remain secure, even when technology
        advances significantly.


        Mobile Devices with Web3 Technology: Mobile phones that use Web3 and ZKP technology
        will enable more private and secure applications. Imagine using a banking
        app on your phone that conducts transactions without sharing your personal
        data. Thanks to ZKP, these apps can operate securely on blockchain networks,
        protecting your information and making it inaccessible to unauthorized third
        parties.


        ## Conclusion


        Zero-Knowledge Proofs are revolutionizing online privacy and security – allowing
        something to be proven without revealing a secret or detailed personal information.
        This is a game changer particularly in regulated industries where breaches
        can result in significant fines and compensation.


        While challenges remain, advancements are making ZKPs more practical. This
        technology promises more secure and private systems for everyone, regardless
        of technical expertise.

        Our personal data is a new and valuable form of currency. We’ve become progressively
        more comfortable sharing our data with third parties, yet we don’t ask often
        enough what privacy and protection policies they have in place.


        When you book a hotel room, you hand over your passport for the front desk
        agent to scan and copy. When you file a health insurance claim, you submit
        detailed medical records that may reveal sensitive information unrelated to
        the specific claim. Each exchange exposes your personal data to an unknown
        number of people in these organizations. If your information is stored and
        saved, it is vulnerable to theft or data breaches, which are becoming alarmingly
        common.


        PROMOTED


        According to the Identity Theft Resource Center''s [2023 Annual Data Breach
        Report](https://www.idtheftcenter.org/post/2023-annual-data-breach-report-reveals-record-number-of-compromises-72-percent-increase-over-previous-high/
        "https://www.idtheftcenter.org/post/2023-annual-data-breach-report-reveals-record-number-of-compromises-72-percent-increase-over-previous-high/"),
        there was a 78% surge in data compromises from 2022 to 2023. Healthcare, financial
        services and transportation organizations reported a twofold increase in compromises
        compared to the previous year. In [a 2023 International Association of Privacy
        Professionals report](https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/privacy_and_consumer_trust_report_summary.pdf
        "https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/privacy_and_consumer_trust_report_summary.pdf"),
        almost 68% of global consumers said "they are either somewhat or very concerned
        about their online privacy," which "affects how much they trust companies,
        organizations and governments to collect, hold and use their personal data."
        More than 80% of people affected by a data breach said they are inclined to
        end their business relationship with a company after the cyberattack.


        ## The Potential Of Zero-Knowledge Proofs


        A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic technique that [dates back
        to the 1980s](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brief-history-zero-knowledge-proofs-100000129.html
        "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brief-history-zero-knowledge-proofs-100000129.html")
        and now offers immense promise in a wide range of practical applications.
        In simple terms, a zero-knowledge proof allows one party to confirm the validity
        of a piece of information with another party without revealing the information
        itself.


        For example, a ZKP can give you a secure key or certificate to prove to a
        bartender that you are of legal drinking age without showing your ID. It can
        also enable a credit card company to verify your creditworthiness without
        divulging your financial history. Zero-knowledge proofs have enormous potential
        to improve data privacy protocols in ways that benefit both organizations
        and individuals. They relieve organizations of the burden of safely gathering,
        storing and sharing people’s data—and managing the damaging repercussions
        if a breach occurs. And they give individuals enhanced identity and transaction
        verification capabilities that won’t put their personal data at risk.


        Real-world use cases of ZKPs include:


        **• Identity Verification:** Businesses can confirm a customer’s name, age,
        driver’s license or passport number, or other personally identifiable information
        (PII) without copying or storing it.


        **• Financial Services:** Banks and other financial institutions can assess
        a customer’s financial health or enable secure, private transactions without
        revealing sensitive information.


        **• Healthcare:** Providers can validate a patient''s insurance information,
        medical history or eligibility for specific treatments without disclosing
        PII.


        • **Voting Systems:** Voters can prove that they are eligible to vote and
        that their vote was counted while maintaining the privacy of their choices.


        • **Supply Chain Management:** Companies can authenticate products without
        revealing proprietary information.


        ## Overcoming Challenges In Implementing Zero-Knowledge Proofs


        While consumers and business leaders alike are showing a growing interest
        in tools that offer increased data privacy protections, implementing zero-knowledge
        proofs will require overcoming key hurdles. ZKP technology requires substantial
        computational power, which can be costly and resource-intensive for organizations
        to implement. There is a shortage of expertise in this emerging field of cryptography,
        making it challenging for businesses to find skilled professionals to develop
        and implement zero-knowledge proof systems. Integrating and scaling ZKP technology
        within organizations’ existing infrastructure and processes may also pose
        technical challenges that slow widespread adoption.


        I believe that in the next few years, we will begin to see a significant shift
        in our collective mindset about divulging our personal information. As zero-knowledge
        proof technology continues to advance and become more affordable, we will
        see a rapid uptake in adoption. In five or ten years'' time, we could see
        changes such as the emergence of tokenized identities, eliminating the need
        to share actual ID numbers or documents, and a significant decrease in identity
        theft as sensitive data becomes less vulnerable to breaches.


        But we have to start changing our outlook and our actions now to prepare for
        this future. I recommend the following actions:


        ### 1\. Advocate For Government Implementation


        Government agencies are responsible for issuing and verifying valid identification
        documents, so making change at the governmental level is an important starting
        point. Push for agencies to invest in zero-knowledge proof systems that will
        drive broader adoption and standardization.


        ### 2\. Start With High-Value, Low-Complexity Use Cases


        For business applications, begin implementing ZKPs in areas that offer clear
        benefits and have manageable complexity, such as identity verification or
        regulatory compliance. Experiment with small projects, and learn and iterate
        as you expand into larger initiatives.


        ### 3\. Leverage Open-Source Frameworks


        Technology can advance far more quickly in an environment of collaboration.
        Utilize existing open-source zero-knowledge proof frameworks to accelerate
        development, reduce costs, share lessons learned and benefit from community-tested
        solutions.


        ### 4\. Invest In Education And Training


        A few years ago, "prompt engineer" was not a common job title. Now, with the
        explosion of generative AI, it''s an important role for many companies. Be
        proactive about investing in educating and training your team in the skills
        of the future, including in cryptography and zero-knowledge proof technology.


        Zero-knowledge proofs offer a powerful tool for safeguarding data privacy
        in a digital world. As the technology continues to advance, it will likely
        play a crucial role in guaranteeing permissions across various business use
        cases and protecting individuals'' privacy rights. If you understand the value
        of this technology and explore opportunities to leverage it effectively, your
        business will be ideally positioned to improve its security posture and build
        trust with your customers.

        # Solving An Open Problem in Zero-Knowledge Proofs   Established an approach
        for zero-knowledge arguments that do not leak secret information even if randomness
        is reused during proof generation


        News Highlights:


        1. ◆For the first time in the world, we have proved that the use of witness
        encryption1 is indispensable for the construction of highly secure zero-knowledge
        proofs2 called the resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument3,4.

        2. ◆This achievement contributes to the practical application of zero-knowledge
        proof, which is expected to be used in various fields such as finance, medical
        care, and healthcare, as one of the IOWN PETs5 aiming for "a world without
        plaintext."


        TOKYO - September 19, 2024 - NTT Corporation (Headquarters: Chiyoda Ward,
        Tokyo; Representative Member of the Board and President: Akira Shimada; hereinafter
        "NTT") has proved for the first time in the world that the use of witness
        encryption is essentially indispensable for the construction of the resettable
        statistical zero-knowledge argument, which is a zero-knowledge proof with
        high security. Zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic protocol that proves
        the validity of a statement without revealing additional information to the
        other party. As an example, this revolutionary technology can prove the knowledge
        of the correct password without disclosing the password. This achievement
        established a construction approach for the resettable statistical zero-knowledge
        argument, thereby greatly contributing to the practical application of zero-knowledge
        proofs, which are expected to be used in various fields such as finance, medical
        care, and healthcare in the future. This achievement was presented at the
        44th Annual International Cryptology Conference (Crypto 2024), the premier
        international conference on cryptology.


        ### 1\. Background


        Zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic protocol that proves the validity
        of a statement without disclosing any additional information. For example,
        it can be used as an authentication technology to prove the knowledge of the
        correct password without disclosing the password. It is also a revolutionary
        technology from the viewpoint of privacy protection because it enables age
        verification without presenting personal information to the other party (Figure
        1). In recent years, it has attracted attention because it has also been used
        in cryptocurrencies to prove that transactions were executed correctly while
        keeping the contents of transactions secret.


        Resettable statistical zero-knowledge arguments are highly secure zero-knowledge
        proofs and known to be constructed using a cryptographic primitive called
        witness encryption. However, it has been an open question whether resettable
        statistical zero-knowledge arguments can be constructed without witness encryption.


        ![Figure 1 Example of Age Verification with Zero-Knowledge Proof](https://group.ntt/en/newsrelease/2024/09/19/img/240919aa.jpg)Figure
        1 Example of Age Verification with Zero-Knowledge Proof


        ### 2\. Results and technical points of this research


        This time, we solved the open problem by proving that it is impossible to
        construct a resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument without using witness
        encryption. Specifically, we have shown that witness encryption can be constructed
        by using a resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument, thereby showing
        that constructing a resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument is equivalent
        to constructing witness encryption (Figure 2).


        As a technical point, in this research, instead of directly using the security
        of the resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument to construct witness
        encryption, we used it indirectly and constructed witness encryption from
        the resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument by the following two steps.


        1. First, we show that a resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument always
        satisfies certain properties because of its high security.

        2. Next, we show that witness encryption can be realized by using this property.


        Specifically, we first focus on the fact that the high security of the resettable
        statistical zero-knowledge argument places significant constraints on the
        messages sent by the prover, and show that in certain cases the messages sent
        by the prover must be determined only by the randomness used by the prover,
        independent of the secret information held by the prover. Next, we focus on
        the fact that this property can be used to realize witness encryption relatively
        easily, thereby constructing witness encryption from a resettable statistical
        zero-knowledge argument (Figure 3).

        3 Technical Points of this Study


        ### 3．Outlook


        We will continue to promote the R&D of zero-knowledge proofs as a technology
        of IOWN PETs, with the aim of achieving the goal of the "world without plaintext,"
        where safe data distribution is enabled by the technical guarantee that data
        will be used only within the scope of the data owner''s policy during the
        entire period from creation to destruction. In the future, we aim to utilize
        this technology for our LLM tsuzumi''s secure learning and to put it into
        practical use for IOWN PETs.


        ### \[Glossary\]


        1.Witness encryption


        Witness encryption is an encryption scheme proposed as a generalization of
        public-key encryption. In normal public-key encryption, encryption is performed
        with a public key and decryption is performed with the corresponding private
        key, but in witness encryption, encryption is performed with an arbitrary
        NP instance (e.g., mathematical theorems) and decryption is performed with
        the corresponding witness (e.g., proof of a theorem).


        2.Zero-knowledge proof


        Zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic protocol between two parties called
        a prover and a verifier. Broadly speaking, in a zero-knowledge proof, the
        prover tries to convince the verifier of the correctness of a statement in
        the following way: At the start of a proof, both the prover and the verifier
        have the statement to be proved as public information, and the prover has
        the evidence that the statement holds as secret information. (The evidence
        is called "witness.") Then, the prover proves that the statement is true by
        conducting a question-and-answer type interaction in which the prover answers
        the question by the verifier, and the verifier verifies the proof by checking
        the content of the response by the prover. Zero-knowledge proofs provide three
        security guarantees: completeness (a prover with appropriate evidence can
        prove a true statement), soundness (a malicious prover cannot prove a false
        statement), and zero-knowledge (a malicious verifier cannot learn information
        on the evidence beyond the validity of the statement).


        3.Statistical zero-knowledge argument


        Zero-knowledge proofs are classified into computational and statistical depending
        on what kind of computing power an adversary has in the definition of zero-knowledge,
        and also into proof and argument depending on what kind of computing power
        an adversary has in the definition of soundness. In the case of statistical
        zero-knowledge arguments, zero-knowledge is guaranteed against an adversary
        with unbounded computing power while soundness is guaranteed only against
        an adversary with realistically bounded computing power (specifically, what
        is called a polynomial-time adversary).


        4.Resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument


        The resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument is a statistical zero-knowledge
        argument that guarantees zero-knowledge even when multiple proofs are generated
        using the same randomness. Using randomness is essential for many cryptographic
        primitives, including zero-knowledge proofs. However, the generation of randomness
        (especially that having sufficiently high quality required for cryptographic
        primitives) requires high-cost operations such as the use of physical phenomena.
        An advantage of the resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument is that
        randomness generation is no longer necessary during proof generation. In particular,
        it guarantees zero-knowledge even if randomness is generated in advance and
        subsequently reused in every proof generation. Because of this advantage,
        the resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument can be used even in environments
        where it is difficult to generate randomness because of cost restrictions.

        # What is Zero-Knowledge Proof - a hot technology bringing trustworthiness
        to Web3 privacy?


        Recently, "zero-knowledge proof" is attracting attention. In 2019, the World
        Economic Forum announced zero-knowledge proof as one of the five privacy-enhancing
        technologies that bring new value to the financial sector (\*1). Why is this
        idea, invented in the 1980s, receiving attention now? This article gives an
        overview of the technology, examples of its application, and looks into its
        future.

        Services: Using Privacy Enhancing Techniques to Unlock New Value," September

        ## What is Zero-Knowledge Proof?


        Zero-knowledge proof; ZKP is a technology in which a person who wants to prove
        something (Prover; hereafter referred to as P) proves the fact that he knows
        the knowledge without giving any other knowledge to the person who wants to
        verify it (Verifier; hereafter referred to as V).


        As a result, V can only verify the fact that P knows the knowledge without
        obtaining any other knowledge (Figure 1).


        ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img01.png?h=378&iar=0&w=800&rev=6d7d71ac7c564b25984a2df33508640b)


        Figure 1: Concept of Zero-Knowledge Proof



        In the real world, when you want to assert that you hold certain credentials,
        it is common to present evidence to convince the other person that you hold
        the credentials.


        However, when you do so, the other person may be presented with too much information
        about what you want to prove, such as your address or age in the evidence.
        If you cannot trust the other person, you may feel uncomfortable giving them
        too much information. However, if you don''t show them the evidence, they
        are unlikely to trust your claim. How can you convince someone that you hold
        the qualification without giving them extra information?


        The technology to achieve this is zero-knowledge proof. The idea of zero-knowledge
        proof originated in cryptography research in the 1980s (\*2).


        - (\*2) [Goldwasser, S., Micali, S., Rackoff, C.: "The knowledge complexity
        of interactive proof-systems," STOC 1985.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/22145.22178)



        The claims that can be proven with zero-knowledge proof are knowledge about
        propositions. A proposition is a verbal expression of a judgment that is clearly
        true or false (\*3).


        - (\*3)

        For example, "2023 is equal to 7×17×17" is a proposition, and it is a true
        fact. "I know the prime factorization of 2023" is knowledge related to the
        stated proposition and is an example of a claim that can be used for zero-knowledge
        proof. On the other hand, "2023 is a large number" is subjective and not a
        proposition. Therefore, the claim that "I know 2023 is a big number" is not
        a subject of zero-knowledge proof.



        In general, a zero-knowledge proof must satisfy three properties: completeness,
        soundness, and zero-knowledge (Table 1).


        | Nature | Overview |

        | --- | --- |

        | Completeness | If the prover is correct, it will be determined to be correct
        by the verifier |

        | Soundness | If the prover is incorrect, it must be determined to be incorrect
        by the verifier with a high probability |

        | Zero-Knowledge | The verifier cannot obtain any knowledge other than the
        fact that the prover wants to prove |


        Table 1: Requirements for a zero-knowledge proof


        ## Intuitive understanding of Zero-Knowledge Proofs


        Here are two examples to help you understand zero-knowledge proofs intuitively.


        ### 1\. The cave problem


        This explanation was introduced in the paper "How to explain zero-knowledge
        protocols to your children" (\*4).


        - (\*4) [Jean-Jacques Quisquater et al., "How to Explain Zero-Knowledge Protocols
        to Your Children," CRYPTO 1989. (PDF: 227KB)](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mkowalcz/628.pdf)


        Inside the cave is a magic door that opens when you say the password. The
        prover P knows the password and gives it in exchange for money. The door is
        at the far end of the cave shown in Figure 2. There are two paths to the door,
        A and B. The person who knows the password can open the door and move from
        A to B or vice versa.


        ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img02.jpg?h=453&iar=0&w=800&rev=cf4c7228935441d3b38f0fd9442af117)


        Figure 2: The Cave Problem



        V, the verifier, wants to buy the password, but he doubts whether P really
        knows the password and cannot start a transaction. If P can convince V that
        P knows the secret password without telling V the secret password itself,
        V can start a transaction. So, here''s what they are trying to do.


        First, V waits outside the cave. Then P enters the cave, randomly chooses
        either path A or B, and goes to the door (Figure 3).


        ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img03.jpg?h=533&iar=0&w=800&rev=0918e3fa17984bbe8d735ff3c9df3166)


        Figure 3: Prover P''s Random Selection



        Next, V enters the cave, goes to the branching point of the paths, randomly
        chooses A or B in their head, and shouts to P to come out from the chosen
        path (Figure 4).


        ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img04.jpg?h=401&iar=0&w=800&rev=945bfc0651e54daea0b604e2edd6f2a4)


        Figure 4: Verifier V''s Random Selection



        If P knows the password:


        P can use the password to open the door and come out of the designated path,
        whichever way V tells him to go (Figure 5). This means completeness.


        ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img05.jpg?h=466&iar=0&w=800&rev=6088ed6bec1c4fd3a3ac05b15c69a53a)


        Figure 5: The Case that Prover P Knows the Password



        If P does not know the password:


        P can only come out of the path he entered, so the probability of coming out
        of the path chosen by V is 50%. If they repeat this process over and over
        again, it''s almost impossible for P to fool V every time (Figure 6). For
        example, if they try 30 times, the probability that P can fool V is about
        0.0000001%. This means soundness.


        ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img06.jpg?h=421&iar=0&w=800&rev=db7f0b94506a47679157cddc1b1a33bf)


        Figure 6: The Case that Prover P Does Not Know the Password



        So, if P succeeds on all his attempts, V must be convinced that P knows the
        password. If V tries even more, he can get his chance of being cheated as
        close to 0% as V wants. At this time, V will not gain any knowledge about
        the password. This means zero-knowledge.


        Literally, what P wants to prove has been proved to V with zero-knowledge.


        ### 2\. The Problem of Finding a Seabird


        Professor Amit Sahai of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) explains
        the concept of zero-knowledge proof on YouTube to children, teenagers, college
        students, graduate students, and experts in five different difficulty levels
        (\*5). Here is a child-friendly explanations that will help you get a sense
        of the main points.


        - (\*5) [Computer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty,
        WIRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c)


        The professor shows the child a picture. The picture shows a crowd of hundreds
        of penguins. He says, "There is one puffin (a penguin-like seabird), and I
        know where it is, but I don''t want to tell you. Do you believe me? I''m going
        to prove it without revealing its location."


        ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img07.jpg?h=505&iar=0&w=800&rev=3f05fc0c1f934735a75fbbae8353800f)


        Figure 7: The Problem of Finding a Seabird



        The professor pulls out a piece of black paper several times larger than the
        photo. The paper has a small hole, and the photo is pasted on the back of
        the paper so that the hole matches the position of the puffin. The child looks
        into the hole and says, "I see a puffin". But the child can''t see the position
        of the photo on the back of the paper, so she can''t tell where the puffin
        is in the original photo. "This is an example of a zero-knowledge proof,"
        the professor explains (Figure 8).


        ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img08.jpg?h=370&iar=0&w=800&rev=46de5598e3f64c609c0c7fd1a156c661)


        Figure 8: Zero-Knowledge Proof for the Problem of Finding a Seabird



        This exchange satisfies completeness because a professor who knows the location
        of the puffin can always prove it.


        Furthermore, it satisfies soundness because if the professor does not know
        the location of the puffin, the cheating will be exposed with a high probability
        if the child looks into the hole and confirms it.


        Furthermore, it satisfies zero-knowledge because the child cannot obtain any
        knowledge other than the fact that the professor knows the location of the
        puffin.


        ## Social Application Examples


        This paper introduces an application example of zero-knowledge proof to society
        and considers prospects.


        ### 1\. Blockchain Privacy Enhancement


        Blockchain is widely used in society, a representative example being virtual
        currencies. Its transparency is maintained by decentralized management of
        its ledger by all participants in the blockchain. However, due to its high
        transparency, securing user privacy may be a challenge.


        In recent years, zero-knowledge proofs have begun to be used to improve blockchain
        privacy. For example, in the case of cryptocurrencies, methods known collectively
        as zk-SNARK (\*6) and zk-STARK (\*7) have begun to be introduced as zero-knowledge
        proofs to show that the transaction operation was indeed performed, without
        disclosing the transaction contents such as the sender, recipient, and remittance
        amount.


        In addition, zero-knowledge proofs have attracted even more attention because
        they can contribute to speeding up blockchain processing.

        ### 2\. Proof of Income Range


        In November 2017, ING, a major Dutch bank, developed zero-knowledge range
        proofs (ZKRP) (\*8). ZKRP is an application of zero-knowledge proofs. ZKRP
        can prove that a numerical value, such as an amount of money, is within a
        certain range without showing the numerical value to the other party. For
        example, mortgage applicants can prove that their income is within a certain
        range required by loan screening without telling the income itself.

        to blockchain technology](https://www.ingwb.com/en/insights/distributed-ledger-technology/ing-launches-major-addition-to-blockchain-technology)


        ### 3\. Selective Disclosure of Attribute Information


        The W3C, which standardizes Web technologies, has standardized a data model
        for the concept of verifiable credentials (VC) (\*9). It introduces zero-knowledge
        proof, in which you select your attribute information and prove only that
        the attribute satisfies certain conditions.


        For example, it shows a use case in which you select and prove only the information
        that a university graduate received a degree without revealing his or her
        identity or other unnecessary personal information.


        - (\*9) [W3C Recommendation, Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1, 2022.](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#zero-knowledge-proofs)



        VC is currently being discussed in the "Trusted Web" initiative led by the
        Cabinet Secretariat of Japan. It shows the expectation of zero-knowledge proof
        as a method to realize selective disclosure of data(\*10).


        - (\*10) [Secretariat of the Headquarters for Digital Market Competition,
        the Cabinet Secretariat of Japan, "Trusted Web White Paper Ver 2.0, Overview"
        August 2022 (PDF: 1.7MB)](https://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/digitalmarket/pdf_e/Trusted_Web_White_Paper_ver2.0_Overview.pdf)


        ### 4\. User Authentication


        Currently, ID and password authentication is mainly used for websites of various
        services. However, since the string length of a password is limited to a range
        that can be remembered or managed by the human brain, it is vulnerable to
        brute-force and password-list-type attacks.


        Furthermore, if an attacker takes over the server, not only the password itself,
        but also information useful for guessing the password is leaked, which becomes
        a hint for the attacker, and the password may be leaked in the future. If
        user authentication is implemented with zero-knowledge proof, the server can
        be more secure because no information related to the password exists from
        the beginning.


        As a zero-knowledge proof that can be applied to user authentication, there
        is the Schnorr protocol (\*11). In this method, knowledge about the solution
        of a mathematically difficult problem called the discrete logarithm problem
        is assumed to be information that only the user can know and is authenticated
        with zero-knowledge proof. Compared with the ID and password method, this
        method has not been adopted in the world for many years due to its disadvantages
        such as high communication volume, slow processing speed, and "The size of
        the data to be kept secret is too large for humans to remember."


        - (\*11) [IETF, RFC 8235, Schnorr Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof, September
        2017](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8235)


        In recent years, however, with the spread of technologies such as "faster
        communication networks," "faster processing speeds of servers and terminals,"
        and "memory areas that can be securely stored in smart cards and smartphones,"
        conventional disadvantages are going to be no longer disadvantages.


        ## Prospect


        In recent years, the term "Web3" has attracted attention, and although there
        are various interpretations, its constituent concepts are said to be centered
        on "blockchain," "decentralization" and "decentralized ID." Application cases
        (1) and (2) mentioned above are measures to improve the privacy of blockchain,
        and (3) and (4) are related to decentralization and decentralized ID. Therefore,
        zero-knowledge proof can be said to be "a technology that brings trustworthiness
        to the privacy of Web3."


        In the future, zero-knowledge proof will become an essential technology for
        safe and secure future societies that require a high level of privacy.


        NTT DATA will continue to keep up with the latest trends and accumulate and
        disclose know-hows.
