        Lens is about to launch their mainnet—they just changed their handle to @LC.
        Yes, LC! @ZKcandyHQ is preparing to establish its Foundation. Meanwhile, real-world
        adoption is accelerating in Argentina, where driver’s licenses are now on-chain
        via the miBA app, powered by @Quark_ID and @ZKsync. And there’s still more
        to come...


        Markets shift but resilience drives builders forward, expanding the Elastic
        Network and proving that ZK is the endgame!


        ==========


        In this edition, we bring you some exciting updates on the ZKsync and Elastic
        Network ecosystem, such as @LC, @Quark_ID, @ZKsyncIgnite, @AbstractChain,
        @cronos_chain zkEVM, @symbiosis_fi, @ZKcandyHQ, @heurist_ai, @RFX_exchange,
        @noon_capital, @sophon, @grvt_io, @XPLA_Official, @SpaceandTimeDB, @Treasure_DAO,
