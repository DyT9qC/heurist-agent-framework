    response: "It looks like I didn't receive a proper query response. Let's break\
      \ down the original request into a simulated SQL query, and I'll provide the\
      \ response in the desired format. I'll also explain the process for clarity.\n\
      \n**Original Request:**\nGet the number of blocks created on Ethereum per day\
      \ over the last month\n\n**Simulated SQL Query (if Space and Time data platform\
      \ supported direct SQL input):**\n```sql\nSELECT \n  DATE_TRUNC('day', block_timestamp)\
      \ AS day,\n  COUNT(block_hash) AS num_blocks\nFROM \n  ethereum.blocks\nWHERE\
      \ \n  block_timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 month'\nGROUP BY \n  DATE_TRUNC('day',\
      \ block_timestamp)\nORDER BY \n  day ASC;\n```\n**Explanation of the Simulated\
      \ Query:**\n\n* **SELECT**: We're selecting two main pieces of information:\n\
      \t+ `DATE_TRUNC('day', block_timestamp) AS day`: This truncates the block's\
      \ timestamp to the day level, grouping all blocks created on the same day together.\n\
      \t+ `COUNT(block_hash) AS num_blocks`: This counts the number of unique block\
      \ hashes (i.e., the number of blocks) for each day.\n* **FROM `ethereum.blocks`**:\
      \ We're querying the `blocks` table within the Ethereum schema.\n* **WHERE `block_timestamp\
      \ >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 month'`**: This filters the results to only include\
      \ blocks created within the last month from the current time.\n* **GROUP BY\
      \ `DATE_TRUNC('day', block_timestamp)`**: Groups the results by each unique\
      \ day.\n* **ORDER BY `day ASC`**: Orders the results in ascending chronological\
      \ order by day.\n\n**Simulated Response (since we can't execute the actual query):**\n\
      \nAssuming the last month's data (for demonstration purposes, let's say from\
      \ March 1, 2023, to March 31, 2023), here's a simulated response:\n\n| **Day**\
      \       | **Number of Blocks (`num_blocks`)** |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------|\n\
      | 2023-03-01   | 6500                                |\n| 2023-03-02   | 6200\

      \ 2023-03-26   | 6300                                |\n| ...          | ...\
