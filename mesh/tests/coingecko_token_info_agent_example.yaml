    **Description**

    Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source platform for building decentralized applications
    (dApps). It enables the creation of smart contracts, facilitating the programming
    of digital value. Examples of dApps on Ethereum include tokens, non-fungible tokens
    (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) apps, lending protocols, and decentralized
    exchanges (DEXs). Transactions and smart contract executions require a fee, known
    as Gas, paid in Ether (ETH).
