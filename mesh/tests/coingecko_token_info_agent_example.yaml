input_comparison:
  query: Compare Bitcoin and Ethereum
output_comparison:
  response: 'Due to repeated API request failures, I am unable to provide real-time
    price or market data for Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, I can offer a general
    comparison based on publicly available knowledge:


    *   **Bitcoin (BTC):** Primarily designed as a decentralized digital currency
    and a store of value. It has a limited supply of 21 million coins. Its main use
    case is peer-to-peer transactions.

    *   **Ethereum (ETH):** A decentralized platform that enables the creation and
    execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Ether (ETH)
    is the cryptocurrency used on the Ethereum network. Ethereum''s use cases extend
    beyond simple transactions, including DeFi, NFTs, and more.


    **Key Distinctions (General):**


    *   **Purpose:** BTC is primarily a store of value and digital currency, while
    ETH is a platform for decentralized applications.

    *   **Technology:** BTC uses a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. Ethereum
    has transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is more
    energy-efficient.

    *   **Supply:** BTC has a fixed supply of 21 million. ETH does not have a hard
    cap on its supply, but its issuance rate is managed.


    For up-to-date information on prices, market capitalization, and other real-time
    data, please consult reliable cryptocurrency data providers.'
