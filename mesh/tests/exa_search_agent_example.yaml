        url: https://research.google/blog/preparing-and-stabilizing-quantum-states-through-engineered-dissipation/
        published_date: N/A
        text: "In our latest work, “Stable Quantum-Correlated Many Body States via\
          \ Engineered Dissipation”, published in Science, we explore a counterintuitive\
          \ effect of environmental dissipation which is often viewed as harmful to\
          \ quantum computing. By carefully engineering dissipation, a new scalable\
          \ protocol for preparing entangled many-body quantum states with lifetimes\
          \ longer than physical qubits was discovered. \n \n \n \n A quantum computer\
          \ can solve certain problems exponentially faster than a classical computer.\
          \ However, current realizations of its building blocks, qubits, are plagued\
          \ by errors induced by uncontrolled interactions between quantum bits (or\
          \ qubits ) and the environment. Such interactions introduce dissipation\
          \ , which destroys quantum entanglement , a necessary resource in quantum\
          \ algorithms, and drives a quantum processor toward trivial, classical states.\
          \ This decoherence process introduces errors, corrupting the utility of\
          \ the quantum processor. As such, environmental dissipation is the main\
          \ limiting factor for the current-generation quantum processors. Paradoxically,\
          \ while uncontrolled dissipation is a bane of current quantum processors\
          \ , engineered dissipation — created with a carefully tailored environment\
          \ — may in fact aid a quantum processor by steering it into a desired entangled\
          \ state. In our latest work, “Stable Quantum-Correlated Many Body States\
          \ via Engineered Dissipation”, published in Science , we explore this counterintuitive\
          \ effect of engineered dissipation. Not only does this method offer a reliable\
          \ way to prepare a quantum state, but it also naturally stabilizes the state\
          \ so that it survives much longer than it would without the dissipation.\
          \ These experiments lay the groundwork for improved methods to prepare strongly\
          \ correlated states (which may be found in e.g. magnets) in a quantum processor,\
          \ which could help physicists learn about exotic quantum materials, such\
          \ as high-temperature superconductors, in the future. \n \n \n Background\
          \ Before a quantum processor can run an algorithm or simulation, all of\
          \ its qubits must be initialized into a known state. This process, known\
          \ as quantum state preparation, is often accomplished by applying quantum\
          \ operations that are coherent — that is, they do not induce any dissipation.\
          \ In this work, we instead couple the qubits to an environment that is tailored\
          \ in just the right way so that the qubits are steered to their desired\
          \ state through dissipation. To demonstrate how this works, we can look\
          \ at one of the simplest examples, where engineered dissipation is used\
          \ to “cool” a quantum system toward its lowest energy state, known as its\
          \ ground state. To accomplish this, we first connect the quantum system\
          \ to another, auxiliary quantum system. Next we can transfer excitations\
          \ from the system of interest to the auxiliary system, then remove the excitations\
          \ via engineered dissipation. The removal of excitations gradually drives\
          \ the system towards its entangled ground state (see illustration below).\
          \ \n \n \n \n In the past, some groups have prepared entangled states of\
          \ up to eight atoms with engineered dissipation. But more intricate, many-body\
          \ entangled states have been out of reach due to environmental decoherence\
          \ caused by other, undesirable dissipation channels. With our Sycamore processor\
          \ , we have developed fast reset capabilities that makes the desired engineered\
          \ dissipation dominant over unwanted dissipation channels. \n \n Experiment\
          \ In this work, we use 35 qubits of a 49-qubit Sycamore processor to emulate\
          \ magnetic spins , while the 14 remaining auxiliary qubits are used to mimic\
          \ the previously mentioned tailored environment. We found that over time,\
          \ this tailored environment imparts a cooling effect on the spin system\
          \ and steers it toward the entangled ground state of a quantum spin model\
          \ known as the transverse-field Ising model . In this model, an array of\
          \ spins are positioned on a lattice, with each either pointing “spin-up”\
          \ or “spin-down.” Neighboring spins interact with one another, and an external\
          \ magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the spin alignment. Depending\
          \ on the relative strengths between the spin interactions and the applied\
          \ magnetic field, the system can be ferromagnetic or paramagnetic . We demonstrate\
          \ the effect of cooling on the spins in this model through a series of experiments.\
          \ First, we set up a 1D system, where a chain of our “spin” qubits are connected\
          \ in a line. Throughout this chain, every few qubits are also connected\
          \ to auxiliaries that act as the dissipative environment (see figure below).\
          \ We found that as the cooling cycles progress, the system settles into\
          \ a correlated state that resembles the ground state of the 1D transverse-field\
          \ Ising model. We then connect our qubits in a two-dimensional lattice (with\
          \ auxiliaries dispersed throughout; see the middle panel below) to perform\
          \ a similar experiment in 2D. We find that, in this 2D system, we can create\
          \ antiferromagnetic correlations between the spins so that they anti-align\
          \ with their neighbors. \n \n \n \n \n When we apply techniques previously\
          \ developed to mitigate errors, we found that we could dissipatively prepare\
          \ ground states with fidelities of 90% for an 18-qubit system. This value\
          \ matches the highest achieved fidelities at comparable system sizes using\
          \ unitary circuits. We also demonstrated theoretically, in the same work,\
          \ that the dissipative state preparation protocol scales more favorably\
          \ vs. system size in terms of preserving state fidelity. These comparisons\
          \ highlight the promise of the dissipative approach. The cooling algorithm\
          \ is expected to be even more advantageous for more intricate correlated\
          \ states, because once the coupling to the tailored environment is engineered,\
          \ then you can just “set it and forget it.” The system naturally evolves\
          \ to the desired state and stays there as long as the dissipation is happening.\
          \ Finally, we demonstrated that engineered dissipation has applications\
          \ to non-equilibrium quantum phenomena beyond state preparation. Here we\
          \ use a 1D system of 26 qubits to emulate a Heisenberg spin chain , a paradigmatic\
          \ correlated system. We drive a current through the chain by periodically\
          \ resetting the spins of two auxiliary qubits at either end. We first studied\
          \ transferred magnetization , whose time dependence is observed to vary\
          \ strongly depending on the underlying parameters of the model, in agreement\
          \ with established theory (see below). At the so-called “isotropic point,”\
          \ where exact solutions of the model are unknown, the team discovered a\
          \ previously unknown phenomenon. At this point, we observed that the spin\
          \ current has a distinct power-law dependence with time, which indicates\
          \ a form of previously unknown, anomalous diffusion for this spin model.\
          \ This result highlights the increasing functionality of the quantum processor\
          \ as a tool for fundamental physics discovery, where the introduction of\
          \ engineered dissipation unveils quantum phenomena that have never been\
          \ observed or theoretically realized. \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion This work\
          \ shows that engineered dissipation strongly enhances the functionality\
          \ of quantum processors, allowing for a conceptually new approach to preparing\
          \ and probing quantum-correlated states. Engineered dissipation will aid\
          \ in the preparation of strongly correlated states, which give rise to new\
          \ quantum phases of matter that are found in materials such as magnets.\
          \ Quantum materials are considered among the most promising applications\
          \ of quantum processors, yet most other protocols for correlated state preparation\
          \ are severely limited by unwanted decoherence. We believe the methods demonstrated\
          \ here will also enable the preparation of intricate many-body states such\
          \ as quantum spin liquids, which may aid in the synthesis of high temperature\
          \ superconductors or new materials for data-storage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\

      - title: Making quantum error correction work
        url: https://research.google/blog/making-quantum-error-correction-work/
        published_date: N/A
        text: "Quantum computers offer promising applications in many fields, ranging\
          \ from chemistry and drug discovery to optimization and cryptography . Most\
          \ of these applications require billions if not trillions of operations\
          \ to execute reliably — not much compared to what your web browser is doing\
          \ right now. But quantum information is delicate, and even state-of-the-art\
          \ quantum devices will typically experience at least one failure in every\
          \ thousand operations. To achieve their potential, performance needs to\
          \ improve dramatically. Today in “ Quantum error correction below the surface\
          \ code threshold ,” published in Nature , we report a qualitative change\
          \ in the way quantum computers perform. This change is powered by combining\
          \ quantum error correction with our latest superconducting quantum processor,\
          \ Willow . Willow is the first processor where error-corrected qubits get\
          \ exponentially better as they get bigger. Each time we increase our encoded\
          \ qubits from a 3x3 to a 5x5 to a 7x7 lattice of physical qubits, the encoded\
          \ error rate is suppressed by a factor of two. This demonstrates the exponential\
          \ error suppression promised by quantum error correction, a nearly 30-year-old\
          \ goal for quantum computing and the key element to unlocking large-scale\
          \ quantum applications. \n \n \n Error-corrected qubits that get better\
          \ as they get bigger To make quantum computers more reliable, we can group\
          \ qubits to work together to correct errors. In surface code quantum computing\
          \ , each group consists of a d x d square lattice of qubits called a surface\
          \ code, and each surface code represents a single encoded or “logical” qubit.\
          \ The bigger a surface code lattice, the more errors it can tolerate. The\
          \ expectation is that as the lattice gets bigger, the logical qubit is more\
          \ and more protected, and the logical performance improves. \n \n \n But\
          \ there’s a subtlety: making the lattice bigger also introduces more opportunities\
          \ for error . If the error rate of the physical qubits is too high, these\
          \ extra errors overwhelm the error correction so that making the lattice\
          \ bigger just makes the processor’s performance worse. Conversely, if the\
          \ error rate of the physical qubits is sufficiently low, then error correction\
          \ more than makes up for these extra errors. In fact, the encoded error\
          \ rate goes down exponentially as more qubits are added. The critical error\
          \ rate that divides these two cases, below which quantum error correction\
          \ transforms from harmful to helpful, is called the threshold . \n \n \n\
          \ \n \n Willow: beating the threshold Operating “below the threshold” has\
          \ been a goal for error corrected quantum computing since its inception\
          \ in the 1990s. However, after almost 30 years of advancement in device\
          \ fabrication, calibration, and qubit design, quantum computers still hadn’t\
          \ passed this landmark. That is, until our latest 105-qubit superconducting\
          \ processor, Willow. Willow represents a significant leap forward in quantum\
          \ hardware. It maintains the tunability of our previous architecture, Sycamore\
          \ , while improving the average qubit lifetimes (T 1 ) from about 20 μs\
          \ to 68 µs ± 13 µs. The qubits and operations in our device are optimized\
          \ with quantum error correction in mind, and run alongside our error correction\
          \ software, including state-of-the-art machine learning , reinforcement\
          \ learning , and graph-based algorithms to identify and correct errors accurately.\
          \ Using Willow, we report the first ever demonstration of exponential error\
          \ suppression with increasing surface code size. Each time we increase our\
          \ lattice in size from 3x3 to 5x5 to 7x7, the encoded error rate decreases\
          \ by a factor of 2.14. This culminates in a logical qubit whose lifetime\
          \ is more than twice that of its best constituent physical qubit, demonstrating\
          \ the capacity of an error-corrected qubit to go beyond its physical components.\
          \ \n \n \n Looking to the future Once you pass the threshold, small improvements\
          \ in the device are amplified exponentially with quantum error correction.\
          \ For example, while the operation fidelities in Willow are about twice\
          \ as good as Sycamore, the encoded error rates are about twenty times better.\
          \ Anticipating this rapid improvement, we can look ahead to questions that\
          \ will be relevant to future error-corrected quantum computers. \n \n \n\
          \ Can we build a near-perfect encoded qubit? Quantum error correction looks\
          \ like it’s working now, but there’s a big gap between the one-in-a-thousand\
          \ error rates of today and the one-in-a-trillion error rates needed tomorrow.\
          \ Could we run into new physics that could prevent us from building a quantum\
          \ computer? To answer this, we build repetition codes . Unlike surface codes,\
          \ which protect against all (local) quantum errors, repetition codes focus\
          \ solely on bitflip errors , but do so far more efficiently. By running\
          \ experiments with repetition codes and ignoring other error types, we achieve\
          \ lower encoded error rates while employing many of the same error correction\
          \ principles as the surface code. The repetition code acts as an advance\
          \ scout for checking whether error correction will work all the way down\
          \ to the near-perfect encoded error rates we’ll ultimately need. When running\
          \ repetition codes on Willow, we are able to realize nearly 10 billion cycles\
          \ of error correction without seeing an error. Exhibiting that level of\
          \ control over a quantum system, even when only protecting against bitflip\
          \ errors, is quite exciting. But there’s a catch — when we try to push the\
          \ encoded error rate lower by increasing the size of the code further, it\
          \ won’t budge. The reason for this behavior is currently under investigation,\
          \ and we’re confident that we can find it and fix it, just as we fixed a\
          \ similar problem with high-energy radiation on Sycamore. \n \n \n Can we\
          \ make error-corrected quantum computers fast? Compared to the gigahertz-frequency\
          \ device you’re probably reading this blog on, error-corrected quantum computers\
          \ are actually quite slow. Even superconducting quantum computers, which\
          \ are one of the fastest qubit technologies, have measurement times that\
          \ are about a microsecond long. The sub-nanosecond timescales of classical\
          \ operations are more than a thousand times faster. Quantum error-corrected\
          \ operations can be even slower , in part because we must also interpret\
          \ measurements to identify errors. This is done by classical software called\
          \ a quantum error decoder , which must process measurement information at\
          \ the rate the quantum computer produces it. In a first for superconducting\
          \ qubits, we demonstrate the ability to decode measurement information in\
          \ real time alongside the device. This is great news, but it must also be\
          \ tempered. Even when decoding is keeping up with the device, for certain\
          \ error-corrected operations, the decoder can still slow things down. We\
          \ measure a decoder delay time of 50 to 100 microseconds on our device,\
          \ and anticipate it will increase at larger lattice sizes. This delay could\
          \ significantly impact the speed of error-corrected operation, and if quantum\
          \ computers are to become practical tools for scientific discovery, we need\
          \ to improve upon it. \n \n \n What’s next? With error correction, we can\
          \ now in principle scale up our system to realize near-perfect quantum computing.\
          \ In practice, it’s not so easy — we still have a long way to go before\
          \ we reach our goal of building a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer.\
          \ \n \n \n At current physical error rates, we might need more than a thousand\

        text: "Quantum computers, which operate based on the fundamental laws of quantum\
          \ mechanics first observed at the atomic-scale, are an emerging technology\
          \ believed to be capable of computational tasks out of the reach of classical\
          \ digital computers. Potential applications of quantum computers range from\
          \ physical simulation – like calculating electronic energies of complex\
          \ molecules – to cryptography – such as cracking RSA encryption [1]. Despite\
          \ their revolutionary potential, quantum computers are extremely sensitive\
          \ to noise introduced through interactions with their environment. This\
          \ noise leads to computational errors, and today’s quantum computers are\
          \ too error-prone to compute the answers to problems that are of practical\
          \ utility where they outperform their classical digital counterparts. We\
          \ anticipate that we will need quantum error correction to protect quantum\
          \ computers from noise. \n Quantum error correction is a powerful tool for\
          \ combating the effects of noise. As with error correction in classical\
          \ systems, quantum error correction can exponentially suppress the rate\
          \ of errors by encoding information redundantly. Redundancy protects against\
          \ noise, but it comes at a price: an increase in the number of physical\
          \ quantum bits (qubits) used for computation, and an increase in the complexity\
          \ and duration of computations. The overhead associated with error correction\
          \ can be significant (at the scale of 1000x increases in qubit counts) when\
          \ implemented using the error-prone hardware of a quantum computer. This\
          \ has led to increasing levels of interest in so-called “ hardware-efficient\
          \ ” strategies for quantum error correction [2]. \n In this post, we dive\
          \ into the results of one of our latest experiments at the AWS Center for\
          \ Quantum Computing, published today in Physical Review X [3]. We introduce\
          \ a type of qubit developed at AWS that converts the majority of errors\
          \ into a class of errors called “erasure errors”. Erasure error detection\
          \ and correction, under the right circumstances, can lead to significant\
          \ reductions in error-correction overhead. Our work demonstrates initial\
          \ steps towards implementing this strategy using existing quantum hardware\
          \ based on superconducting quantum circuits, and indicates a potential accelerated\
          \ path forward for building quantum computers of practical utility. \n The\
          \ types of errors that affect qubits \n When we talk about protecting quantum\
          \ computers from errors, what types of errors are we talking about? Quantum\
          \ computers are built from qubits, which can be in one of two quantum states\
          \ (often labeled |0⟩ or |1⟩), or any superposition of these states. Just\
          \ like a classical bit can accidentally flip from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0,\
          \ a quantum bit can also experience a so-called “bit-flip” error where |0⟩\
          \ flips to |1⟩ or vice versa. But unlike classical bits, quantum bits can\
          \ also suffer from “phase-flip” errors, where a superposition |0⟩ + |1⟩\
          \ flips to |0⟩ – |1⟩. In fact, the difficulty of correcting both bit-flip\
          \ and phase-flip errors is one reason why error correction is much harder\
          \ for quantum computers than for classical computers. \n \n Figure 1. Three\
          \ types of errors affecting qubits: (1) bit-flip errors, (2) phase-flip\
          \ errors, and (3) erasure errors. \n \n Bit-flip and phase-flip errors share\
          \ a common trait, which is that they silently corrupt the state of the qubit\
          \ without the operator knowing. But recently, another framework for errors\
          \ has drawn significant attention, based on what are called “erasure errors.”\
          \ These errors also corrupt the state of the qubit, but unlike bit-flip\
          \ and phase-flip errors, erasure errors raise a flag to indicate that the\
          \ qubit was corrupted. \n If we can build a quantum computer out of qubits\
          \ that only have erasure errors, it becomes much easier to correct errors\
          \ as they occur since we actually know which qubits were corrupted. This\
          \ extra information allows us to reduce the redundancy and overhead that\
          \ would be needed to correct an equal number of silent bit-flip and phase-flip\
          \ errors. This idea has recently been gaining traction as a compelling strategy\
          \ to reduce error-correction overhead in several platforms for experimental\
          \ quantum computing, including in neutral atoms [4-6], superconducting circuits\
          \ [7-8], and trapped ions [9]. \n Designing an “erasure qubit” with superconducting\
          \ transmons \n An “erasure qubit” is a qubit which is designed to be primarily\
          \ limited by erasure errors, with only a minimal contribution of bit-flip\
          \ or phase-flip errors. To build such a qubit, we need to encode our qubit\
          \ in a protected way such that the physical processes that drive errors\
          \ in our hardware can only cause erasure errors. \n Our approach at the\
          \ AWS Center for Quantum Computing was to build erasure qubits out of standard\
          \ qubit components, called transmons [10]. Transmons are superconducting\
          \ circuit elements whose discrete quantum states can be controlled and used\
          \ for computation. Typically, it is common to rely on the lowest two energy\
          \ states of the transmon, |0⟩ and |1⟩, to encode a single qubit. These states\
          \ can be thought of as the transmon containing either 0 photons or 1 photon,\
          \ respectively. \n One of the main sources of errors in transmons is the\
          \ photon leaking out, which causes relaxation of the transmon from |1⟩ to\
          \ |0⟩. This is one example of a bit-flip error that scrambles the information\
          \ in a single transmon. To avoid such silent errors, we use an alternate\
          \ encoding proposed by our AWS team [7] that allows us to flag relaxation\
          \ events when they occur. \n \n Figure 2. We encode a single “dual-rail”\
          \ qubit in a pair of transmons in order to be able to flag errors that are\
          \ caused by photon leakage. \n \n Specifically, we use a “dual-rail” encoding\
          \ in two transmons, where the qubit is defined by the two states in which\
          \ just the left transmon has a photon (|10⟩), or just the right transmon\
          \ has a photon (|01⟩). In such an encoding, photon loss does not cause silent\
          \ errors between |01⟩ and |10⟩, but instead causes a transition into a third\
          \ state in which there are no photons left in the system (|00⟩). As long\
          \ as we can check the system to see if it still has one photon, we can find\
          \ out if an error occurred and “flag” an erasure error if no photons are\
          \ detected. \n \n Figure 3. Our dual-rail qubit is encoded by having a single\
          \ photon which is shared across the two transmons to suppress noise, while\
          \ still enabling us to flag photon leakage as an erasure. \n \n We’re almost\
          \ done with our qubit construction – but unfortunately relaxation is not\
          \ the only error mechanism in transmons which requires attention. A second\
          \ important source of errors is so-called “dephasing”, or fluctuations in\
          \ the transmon energy, which would cause the states |01⟩ and |10⟩ to experience\
          \ silent phase-flip errors. \n The solution to this problem requires a quick\
          \ technical deep-dive: rather than letting the transmons operate independently,\
          \ we couple them together. The single photon is now shared by the two transmons,\
          \ either symmetrically or anti-symmetrically, which defines our “logical”\
          \ qubit states: |0 L ⟩=|01⟩−|10⟩ and |1 L ​⟩=|01⟩+|10⟩. Since these states\
          \ both contain half a photon on average in each transmon, it turns out that\
          \ their energy gap is largely insensitive to the underlying transmon energy\
          \ fluctuations. While transmon dephasing can still cause both bit-flips\
          \ and phase-flips of the dual-rail qubit, these rates can be suppressed\
          \ by multiple orders of magnitude compared to the error rates on the underlying\
          \ transmons. This enables the dual-rail qubit to be highly coherent, even\
          \ if the underlying transmon qubit building blocks are themselves very noisy.\
          \ \n At this stage, we have the core ingredients of an erasure qubit: a\
          \ pair of states |0 L ⟩,|1 L ​⟩ which should have very few bit-flip and\
          \ phase-flip errors, and which should primarily be affected just by erasure\
          \ errors (leakage to the state |00⟩). \n The next step is to test it experimentally\
          \ and show: \n \n How rare are the residual bit-flip and phase-flip errors\
          \ relative to the erasure errors? \n Can we detect the leakage to |00⟩ in\
          \ order to truly flag photon loss as erasure errors? \n \n Erasure qubit\
          \ performance \n To test the use of the dual-rail system as an erasure qubit,\
          \ our team at the AWS Center for Quantum Computing designed and fabricated\
          \ a device composed of three transmons – two of which encode the dual-rail\
          \ qubit, while the third is used as an ancilla for detecting and flagging\
          \ erasure errors. This device was cooled down to 10 millikelvin in a dilution\
          \ fridge. \n Error rates on the dual-rail qubit \n We examine the rates\
          \ of the different types of errors by preparing the system in various states\
          \ and tracking its evolution over time. In particular, our goal is to determine\
          \ the fraction of total errors which are erasure errors versus silent bit-flip\
          \ and phase-flip errors. The erasure error rate is measured by initializing\
          \ the system in any state like |0 L ​⟩ or |1 L ​⟩ and measuring the probability\
          \ of finding the system in |00⟩ after some time. We find that this decay\
          \ occurs on a typical timescale of around 30 µs, consistent with independent\
          \ measurements of the rate of photons leaking out of these transmons. \n\
          \ \n Figure 4. Example measurement of error rates on the dual-rail qubit.\
          \ We observe a short timescale for erasure errors caused by decay to |00&gt;.\
          \ In instances where we did not have such decay, we preserve coherence for\
          \ much longer millisecond-scale levels. \n \n The bit-flip and phase-flip\
          \ error rates are extracted by focusing on the instances where a photon\
          \ was not lost. Bit-flip errors are measured by preparing the system in\
          \ |1 L ​⟩ and measuring the probability of finding it in |0 L ​⟩ at a later\
          \ time (or vice versa). Similarly, to measure phase-flip errors we prepare\
          \ the dual-rail qubit in a superposition |0 L ​⟩+|1 L ​⟩​ and measure the\
          \ probability of finding it in the wrong superposition (|0 L​ ⟩−|1 L ​⟩)\
          \ at a later time. These two types of measurements reveal that bit-flip\
          \ and phase-flip errors take place on a much longer time scale of close\
          \ to 1 ms, roughly 30x longer than the timescale for errors on the underlying\
          \ transmons composing the dual-rail qubit. \n As anticipated, the ratio\
          \ of error timescales indicates that the vast majority of errors (&gt; 96%)\
          \ in our dual-rail qubit are erasure errors (leakage to |00⟩), with only\
          \ a small fraction (&lt; 4%) of residual (silent) bit-flip and phase-flip\
          \ errors. This is a strong indicator that if we can accurately flag the\
          \ erasures, then we can efficiently correct most errors that occur in this\
          \ system. \n Detecting erasure errors using an ancilla qubit \n To check\
          \ if a qubit had an erasure error, we have to do a measurement to see if\
          \ the dual-rail system is in the |00⟩ state. In particular, we want to distinguish\
          \ |00⟩ from the |0 L ⟩,|1 L ⟩ states. However, it is important that we do\
          \ not reveal the dual-rail qubit’s logical state if no erasure had occurred.\
          \ For example, if the dual-rail pair is in |0 L ⟩+|1 L ⟩, the erasure check\
          \ should indicate that no erasure has occurred and leave the system in this\
          \ superposition ( without collapsing it into either |0 L ⟩ or |1 L ⟩, which\
          \ would effectively introduce new silent phase-flip errors into the system).\
          \ \n \n Figure 5. The ancilla transmon is shifted in its energy depending\
          \ on the state of the dual-rail qubit, allowing us to detect if the dual-rail\
          \ has decayed to |00&gt;. \n \n This is a rather delicate type of measurement\
          \ to perform. To accomplish this, we use a third “ancilla” transmon which\
          \ is weakly coupled to the dual-rail qubit. The presence or absence of the\
          \ single photon in the dual-rail pair causes a shift of the energy of the\
          \ ancilla. This shift is roughly the same for the two dual-rail states |0\
          \ L​ ⟩ and |1 L ​⟩ which each contain a single photon, but the shift is\
          \ different for the state |00⟩ in which there are no photons. As a result,\
          \ by measuring the energy of the ancilla transmon, we can determine if the\
          \ dual-rail has decayed to |00⟩ without distinguishing |0 L ⟩ and |1 L ⟩.\
          \ \n This approach, at least in principle, allows high-fidelity detection\
          \ of erasure errors without causing additional errors on the dual-rail qubit.\
          \ To verify this point experimentally, we prepare the system in a superposition\
          \ |0 L ​⟩+|1 L ​⟩ and perform a sequence of repeated erasure checks to see\
          \ if the superposition is destroyed. We find very low rates of errors (&lt;0.1%)\
          \ induced by each check, validating this approach as a viable method of\
          \ erasure detection. \n Conclusion \n These experiments, described in our\
          \ recent publication [3], complete the picture of our dual-rail qubit as\
          \ an “erasure qubit” – most errors that occur are indeed erasure errors,\
          \ and those erasure errors can be detected without introducing new errors\
          \ into the system. This work is just the beginning of an exciting path with\
          \ transmon-based erasure qubits, with major next steps needed to complete\
          \ the error-correction toolbox with these new qubits and scale up to larger\
          \ systems. By incorporating new ideas like erasure errors into standard\
          \ transmon processors, we hope to improve error correction performance in\
          \ ways that are compatible with other state-of-the-art developments in the\
          \ field. \n Indeed, this strategy of hardware-efficient error correction\
          \ is just one part of a large sphere of technical challenges in scaling\
          \ up quantum computers, complementing other critical work such as systematic\
          \ improvement of device performance and construction of scalable controls.\
          \ All pieces of technological development must come together on this incredibly\
          \ exciting road towards large-scale, useful quantum computing. \n References\

          \ these challenges is still years away, but Willow marks a significant step\
          \ in that direction, according to Neven and members of his team. \n While\
          \ still in its early stages, scientists believe that superfast quantum computing\
          \ will eventually be able to power innovation in a range of fields. \n Quantum\
          \ research is seen as a critical field and both the United States and China\
          \ have been investing heavily in the area, while Washington has also placed\
          \ restrictions on the export of the sensitive technology. \n Olivier Ezratty,\
          \ an independent expert in quantum technologies, told AFP in October that\
          \ private and public investment in the field has totaled around $20 billion\
          \ worldwide over the past five years. \n Regular computers function in binary\
          \ fashion: they carry out tasks using tiny fragments of data known as bits\
          \ that are only ever either expressed as 1 or 0. \n But fragments of data\
          \ on a quantum computer, known as qubits, can be both 1 and 0 at the same\
          \ time—allowing them to crunch an enormous number of potential outcomes\
          \ simultaneously. \n Crucially, Google's chip demonstrated the ability to\
          \ reduce computational errors exponentially as it scales up—a feat that\
          \ has eluded researchers for nearly 30 years. \n The breakthrough in error\
          \ correction, published in leading science journal Nature , showed that\
          \ adding more qubits to the system actually reduced errors rather than increasing\
          \ them—a fundamental requirement for building practical quantum computers.\
          \ \n Error correction is the \"end game\" in quantum computing and Google\

        text: "In a milestone that brings quantum computing tangibly closer to large-scale\
          \ practical use, scientists at Oxford University Physics have demonstrated\
          \ the first instance of distributed quantum computing. Using a photonic\
          \ network interface, they successfully linked two separate quantum processors\
          \ to form a single, fully connected quantum computer, paving the way to\
          \ tackling computational challenges previously out of reach. The results\
          \ have been published today (5 Feb) in Nature. \n The breakthrough addresses\
          \ quantum's 'scalability problem': a quantum computer powerful enough to\
          \ be industry-disrupting would have to be capable of processing millions\
          \ of qubits. Packing all these processors in a single device, however, would\
          \ require a machine of an immense size. In this new approach, small quantum\
          \ devices are linked together, enabling computations to be distributed across\
          \ the network. In theory, there is no limit to the number of processors\
          \ that could be in the network. \n The scalable architecture is based on\
          \ modules which each contain only a small number of trapped-ion qubits (atomic-scale\
          \ carriers of quantum information). These are linked together using optical\
          \ fibres, and use light (photons) rather than electrical signals to transmit\
          \ data between them. These photonic links enable qubits in separate modules\
          \ to be entangled*, allowing quantum logic to be performed across the modules\
          \ using quantum teleportation.** \n Although quantum teleportation of states\
          \ has been achieved previously, this study is the first demonstration of\
          \ quantum teleportation of logical gates (the minimum components of an algorithm)\
          \ across a network link. According to the researchers, this could lay the\
          \ groundwork for a future 'quantum internet,' where distant processors could\
          \ form an ultra-secure network for communication, computation and sensing.\
          \ \n Study lead Dougal Main from Oxford University Physics, said: \"Previous\
          \ demonstrations of quantum teleportation have focused on transferring quantum\
          \ states between physically separated systems. In our study, we use quantum\
          \ teleportation to create interactions between these distant systems. By\
          \ carefully tailoring these interactions, we can perform logical quantum\
          \ gates -- the fundamental operations of quantum computing -- between qubits\
          \ housed in separate quantum computers. This breakthrough enables us to\
          \ effectively 'wire together' distinct quantum processors into a single,\
          \ fully-connected quantum computer.\" \n The concept is similar to how traditional\
          \ supercomputers work. These are made up of smaller computers linked together\
          \ to achieve capabilities that are greater than those of each separate unit.\
          \ This strategy circumvents many of the engineering obstacles associated\
          \ with packing ever larger numbers of qubits into a single device, while\
          \ preserving the delicate quantum properties needed for accurate and robust\
          \ computations. \n Dougal Main added: \"By interconnecting the modules using\
          \ photonic links, the system gains valuable flexibility, allowing modules\
          \ to be upgraded or swapped out without disrupting the entire architecture.\"\
          \ \n The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of the method by executing\
          \ Grover's search algorithm. This quantum method searches for a particular\
          \ item in a large, unstructured dataset much faster than a regular computer\
          \ can, using the quantum phenomena of superposition and entanglement to\
          \ explore many possibilities in parallel. Its successful demonstration underscores\
          \ how a distributed approach can extend quantum capabilities beyond the\
          \ limits of a single device, setting the stage for scalable, high-performance\
          \ quantum computers powerful enough to run calculations in hours that today's\
          \ supercomputers would take many years to solve. \n Professor David Lucas,\
          \ principal investigator of the research team and lead scientist for the\
          \ UK Quantum Computing and Simulation Hub, led from Oxford University Physics,\
          \ said: \"Our experiment demonstrates that network-distributed quantum information\
          \ processing is feasible with current technology. Scaling up quantum computers\
          \ remains a formidable technical challenge that will likely require new\
          \ physics insights as well as intensive engineering effort over the coming\
          \ years.\" \n *Quantum entanglement: Where two particles, such as a pair\
          \ of photons, remain correlated even when separated by vast distances. This\
          \ allows them to share information without having to travel physically.\

        text: "Researchers at the Universities of Melbourne and Manchester have invented\
          \ a breakthrough technique for manufacturing highly purified silicon that\
          \ brings powerful quantum computers a big step closer. \n The new technique\
          \ to engineer ultra-pure silicon makes it the perfect material to make quantum\
          \ computers at scale and with high accuracy, the researchers say. \n Project\
          \ co-supervisor Professor David Jamieson, from the University of Melbourne,\
          \ said the innovation – published today in Communication Mater ials , a\
          \ Nature journal – uses qubits of phosphorous atoms implanted into crystals\
          \ of pure stable silicon and could overcome a critical barrier to quantum\
          \ computing by extending the duration of notoriously fragile quantum coherence\
          \ . \n “Fragile quantum coherence means computing errors build up rapidly.\
          \ With robust coherence provided by our new technique, quantum computers\
          \ could solve in hours or minutes some problems that would take conventional\
          \ or ‘classical’ computers – even supercomputers – centuries,” Professor\
          \ Jamieson said. \n Quantum bits or qubits* – the building blocks of quantum\
          \ computers – are susceptible to tiny changes in their environment, including\
          \ temperature fluctuations. Even when operated in tranquil refrigerators\
          \ near absolute zero (minus 273 degrees Celsius), current quantum computers\
          \ can maintain error-free coherence for only a tiny fraction of a second.\
          \ \n University of Manchester co-supervisor Professor Richard Curry said\
          \ ultra-pure silicon allowed construction of high-performance qubit devices\
          \ – a critical component required to pave the way towards scalable quantum\
          \ computers. \n “What we’ve been able to do is effectively create a critical\
          \ ‘brick’ needed to construct a silicon-based quantum computer. It’s a crucial\
          \ step to making a technology that has the potential to be transformative\
          \ for humankind,” Professor Curry said. \n Lead author Ravi Acharya, a joint\
          \ University of Manchester/University of Melbourne Cookson Scholar, said\
          \ the great advantage of silicon chip quantum computing was it used the\
          \ same essential techniques that make the chips used in today’s computers.\
          \ \n “Electronic chips currently within an everyday computer consist of\
          \ billions of transistors — these can also be used to create qubits for\
          \ silicon-based quantum devices. The ability to create high quality silicon\
          \ qubits has in part been limited to date by the purity of the silicon starting\
          \ material used. The breakthrough purity we show here solves this problem.\"\
          \ \n Professor Jamieson said the new highly purified silicon computer chips\
          \ house and protect the qubits so they can sustain quantum coherence much\
          \ longer, enabling complex calculations with greatly reduced need for error\
          \ correction. \n “Our technique opens the path to reliable quantum computers\
          \ that promise step changes across society, including in artificial intelligence,\
          \ secure data and communications, vaccine and drug design, and energy use,\
          \ logistics and manufacturing,” he said. \n Silicon – made from beach sand\
          \ – is the key material for today’s information technology industry because\
          \ it is an abundant and versatile semiconductor : it can act as a conductor\
          \ or an insulator of electrical current, depending on which other chemical\
          \ elements are added to it. \n “Others are experimenting with alternatives,\
          \ but we believe silicon is the leading candidate for quantum computer chips\
          \ that will enable the enduring coherence required for reliable quantum\
          \ calculations,” Professor Jamieson said. \n “The problem is that while\
          \ naturally occurring silicon is mostly the desirable isotope silicon-28,\
          \ there’s also about 4.5 percent silicon-29. Silicon-29 has an extra neutron\
          \ in each atom’s nucleus that acts like a tiny rogue magnet, destroying\
          \ quantum coherence and creating computing errors,” he said. \n The researchers\
          \ directed a focused, high-speed beam of pure silicon-28 at a silicon chip\
          \ so the silicon-28 gradually replaced the silicon-29 atoms in the chip,\
          \ reducing silicon-29 from 4.5 per cent to two parts per million (0.0002\
          \ per cent). \n “The great news is to purify silicon to this level, we can\
          \ now use a standard machine – an ion implanter – that you would find in\
          \ any semiconductor fabrication lab, tuned to a specific configuration that\
          \ we designed,” Professor Jamieson said. \n In previously published research\
          \ with the ARC Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication\
          \ Technology , the University of Melbourne set – and still holds – the world\
          \ record for single-qubit coherence of 30 seconds using silicon that was\
          \ less purified. 30 seconds is plenty of time to complete error-free, complex\
          \ quantum calculations. \n Professor Jamieson said the largest existing\
          \ quantum computers had more than 1000 qubits, but errors occurred within\
          \ milliseconds due to lost coherence. \n “Now that we can produce extremely\
          \ pure silicon-28, our next step will be to demonstrate that we can sustain\
          \ quantum coherence for many qubits simultaneously. A reliable quantum computer\
          \ with just 30 qubits would exceed the power of today's supercomputers for\
          \ some applications,” he said. \n This latest work was supported by research\
          \ grants from the Australian and UK governments. Professor Jamieson’s collaboration\
          \ with the University of Manchester is supported by a Royal Society Wolfson\
          \ Visiting Fellowship. \n A 2020 report from Australia’s CSIRO estimated\
          \ that quantum computing in Australia has potential to create 10,000 jobs\
          \ and $2.5 billion in annual revenue by 2040. \n “Our research takes us\
          \ significantly closer to realising this potential,” Professor Jamieson\
          \ said. \n *A qubit – such as an atomic nucleus, electron, or photon – is\
          \ a quantum object when it is in a quantum superposition of multiple states.\
          \ Coherence is lost when the qubit reverts to a single state and becomes\
          \ a classical object like a conventional computer bit, which is only ever\
          \ one or zero and never in superposition. \n ||||I||||Skip to main content\n\

      - title: Researchers use laser beams to pioneer new quantum computing breakthrough

          \ Photonics (2024). DOI: 10.1063/5.0230335\n \n Physicists from the University\
          \ of the Witwatersrand (Wits) have developed an innovative computing system\
          \ using laser beams and everyday display technology, marking a significant\
          \ leap forward in the quest for more powerful quantum computing solutions.\
          \ \n The breakthrough, achieved by researchers at the university's Structured\
          \ Light Lab, offers a simpler and more cost-effective approach to advanced\
          \ quantum computing by harnessing the unique properties of light. This development\
          \ could potentially speed up complex calculations in fields such as logistics,\
          \ finance and artificial intelligence. The research was published in the\
          \ journal APL Photonics as the editor's pick. \n \"Traditional computers\
          \ work like switchboards, processing information as simple yes or no decisions.\
          \ Our approach uses laser beams to process multiple possibilities simultaneously,\
          \ dramatically increasing computing power,\" says Dr. Isaac Nape, the Optica\
          \ Emerging Leader Chair in Optics at Wits. \n The research team, including\
          \ MSc students Mwezi Koni and Hadrian Bezuidenhout, built their system using\
          \ surprisingly ordinary components—laser beams, digital displays similar\
          \ to those found in projectors, and simple lenses. \n The key was linking\
          \ how light interacts with optical devices, such as digital displays and\
          \ lenses, to the mathematical operations that a quantum operation in a quantum\
          \ computer performs. These operations can be simply broken down to multiplication\
          \ and addition (using vectors and matrices) all performed at the speed of\
          \ light. \n Once this was achieved, they showcased the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm,\
          \ a clever test determining whether an operation performed by a computer\
          \ is random or predictable—something a quantum computer can do far faster\
          \ than any classical computing machine. \n \"Our work paves the way for\
          \ simulating even more complex quantum algorithms,\" Koni adds. \"This could\
          \ unlock exciting new possibilities in areas like quantum optimization and\
          \ quantum machine learning.\" \n Their method can handle far more information\
          \ than conventional computers, which are limited to working with just ones\
          \ and zeros. \n \"We've shown that our system can work with 16 different\
          \ levels of information instead of just the two used in classical computers,\"\
          \ says Koni, who led the experiment. \"In theory, we could expand this to\
          \ handle millions of levels, which would be a game-changer for processing\
          \ complex information.\" \n What makes this development particularly significant\
          \ for South Africa and other emerging economies is its accessibility. The\
          \ system uses readily available equipment, making it a practical option\
          \ for research laboratories that may not have access to more expensive computing\
          \ technologies. \n \"Light is an ideal medium for this kind of computing,\"\
          \ says Bezuidenhout. \"It moves incredibly fast and can process multiple\
          \ calculations simultaneously. This makes it perfect for handling complex\
          \ problems that would take traditional computers much longer to solve.\"\
          \ \n The research forms part of the WitsQ Quantum Initiative and is supported\
          \ by the South African Quantum Initiative (SAQuTI), positioning South Africa\
          \ at the forefront of advanced computing research . The team is now working\
          \ on expanding their system's capabilities, which could lead to even more\
          \ powerful computing solutions in the future. \n This development represents\
          \ a significant step forward in making advanced computing more accessible\
          \ and practical, particularly for regions where cutting-edge technology\
          \ infrastructure might be limited by cost constraints. \n More information:\
