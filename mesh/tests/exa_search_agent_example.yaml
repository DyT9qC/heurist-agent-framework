      answer: As of March 15, 2025, quantum error correction (QEC) remains a critical
        area in quantum computing, aimed at protecting quantum information from errors
        due to decoherence and noise. QEC techniques involve encoding logical qubits
        into multiple physical qubits, enabling the detection and correction of errors
        that can occur during quantum computations ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_error_correction),
        [Riverlane](https://www.riverlane.com/quantum-error-correction)). Recent advancements,
        such as Google's Willow processor, demonstrate improved error correction capabilities,
        allowing for more robust logical qubits that enhance computational reliability
        ([Google Research](https://research.google/blog/making-quantum-error-correction-work),
        [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y)). These developments
        are vital for achieving practical quantum computing, as they address the challenges
        posed by error accumulation in quantum systems.
